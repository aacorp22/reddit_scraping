134l03a,DD,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

13490r5,DD,"Betting On 00 - Part 2: A Conversation On The Theoretical Nature Of Debt (Published Mar. 20, 2023)","Betting on 00 Part II: The Mechanism

Not a financial advisor

The second part of the story is more theoretical, but this is still a shared story. All publicly accessible data.

Abstract: Many of the problems that have lingered since the 07-08 financial crisis have not been resolved. In light of recent developments within the global financial markets, this paper draws on data points and articles to lay out the case that things can, theoretically, deteriorate further. This begins and ends with debt; from debt blind spots, to the Bond problem,  Mortgage Backed Securities, the Japan problem, unsustainable yields, ending with a theoretical discussion on the nature of institutional lending. It concludes with a personal anecdote on how the house always wins; except when it doesn’t.

There was a news article in the recent past, published by Reuters on December 6, 2022, titled *FX Swap Debt a $80 Trillion ‘blind spot’ BIS Says.* The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), per their website, has a mission to “act as a bank for central banks”. 

Essentially, the article references a triennial report from BIS that highlights five different points on economic conditions. The current point, an $80 trillion ‘blind spot’, is debt. This debt is held by pension funds and other ‘non-banks’. Why this is significant is because the debt is hidden, off-balance (ie. Not “Public”). It is well known that a crisis almost emerged in the UK gilt (ie. “Bond”) market in September; there is more to the story, but the Bank of England was forced to buy bonds, in the face of rising interest rates, at the risk of pension funds “failing”. This can be illustrated in graph 1, directly from the BIS December report: 

[Graph 1](https://preview.redd.it/xp2ixv0ig4xa1.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f59a628214fc1b9c2fc4ad909249c2b6c397e96)

&#x200B;

Referencing 1B and the article linked above, the date of September 22nd, 2022, was approximately when the Bank of England intervened, in order to “save” pension funds. 

The way pension funds invest is complex, and can be obscure; however, it is a fact that pension funds (amongst other actors) rely on Mortgage Backed Securities in order to obtain a certain yield. Shown below is graph 2 from the triennial report. (Source: BIS).  

&#x200B;

[Graph 2](https://preview.redd.it/zbzpk78lg4xa1.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4accdbe1bff6ace1c3c2c9b7b263783fdfae02d8)

These graphs are important due to, mostly, 2B (although the fact that liquidity has deteriorated is also important). What 2B shows is a comparison between MBS transactions for the Covid-19 period, the 2022 interest rate increases, and the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Let me make this clear: this is not 2007-08. But one can see similar comparisons. The facts are that Misc non-banks (including pension funds) were large buyers of MBS’s during Covid-19, a time when interest rates were historically low. They were not the largest buyers (see: Small investors & leveraged fund); however, they were not buyers during the GFC. This time, they were buying. Due to policy constraints, the Federal Reserve is unable to “backstop” certain things. The goal of the Fed is to ensure smooth monetary policy. (Source: BIS) Should something occur in the macroeconomic space, policy may shift.

51 out of 52 countries. What this is a reference to is that the n=52 country happens to be Japan.

&#x200B;

[Graph 3](https://preview.redd.it/yedwb2grg4xa1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a76c99832c032360e000ef5a295bd93f8b47ac6)

It is interesting to note that, using Japan as an example, investors in this country have “bet” that yield curve control policies would eventually be relaxed (Source: BIS). The current policy caps the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds at 25 basis points. Another interesting fact is that, currently, Japan’s debt:GDP ratio sits at 263.9%. 51 out of 52 countries.

So what does this all mean? Well, this is where it becomes more theoretical. First, on to mREIT’s.

One of the ways in which mREITs (mortgage real estate investment trusts) obtain a superior yield is through the “lending” of MBS. I am quoting the authors here (Aragonite & Rungcharoenkitkul, 2022) “Large amounts of debt- often in the form of short-term repos- allow mREITs to pay out double-digit yields” I will take Prologis, a traditional REIT example, as an example: -21.71%/1 Year (Robinhood: Ticker PLD. Accessed 12:00 a.m. GMT). 2.63 Div/yield. Table 1 is an example of yields for some larger mREITs (Source: Stock Market MBA.com: Accessed 12:22 a.m. GMT). 

&#x200B;

[Table 1](https://preview.redd.it/fdr4w0qvg4xa1.png?width=2575&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6814f288af8616804f54ca618a47b073b58446d9)

I won’t explain all the variables in depth, but the two most important for the sake of the article are market cap and current dividend/yield. The market cap is significant; the current dividend yield is not sustainable. In order to understand why, one needs to understand what a short term repo fundamentally is, as well as what the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is.

A Repo, also termed as a Repurchase Agreement, is defined as “A form of short-term borrowing for dealers in government securities”. In reality, these agreements are a form of lending, and I theorize this will become a point of instability in global markets. Let me explain further.

What occurs in a repo is that a “dealer” sells government securities (ie. Bonds) to an investor. This is done on an overnight basis for the most part, but 48 hour long agreements are not unheard of. What makes these profitable trades involves interest rates; essentially, the dealer sells for an agreed upon price, and buys them back for an incrementally higher price. This price is usually slight, or else the trade becomes unprofitable. This is where two important variables are introduced: Term V. Open Repo agreements. These two differ on the length of the “agreement”; Term Repos have a specified maturity, while Open Repos are transactions without a set maturity date. This is important in light of the fact that the interest rate on an Open Repo is generally very close to the federal funds rate. 

That moves me onto my next point of emphasis: SOFR.

A simple explanation of SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is that it is a benchmark interest rate for dollar-denominated derivatives and loans that is replacing the LIBOR. One may not know that this is a purposeful transition; SOFR began publishing in April 2018, as an alternative reference rate. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the LIBOR will be phased out and replaced; banks were instructed to stop writing contracts using LIBOR by the end of 2021, and all contracts *should* wrap up by June 30, 2023. Why is this important? Well, this transition is expected to increase short term volatility. Per the New York Fed Alternative Reference Rates Committee, “the transition from LIBOR is important because the potential disruption or cessation of LIBOR poses a financial stability risk as well as a risk to the individual firms with LIBOR exposure”. Essentially, this is the period of transition. This becomes even more critical in light of additional information.

&#x200B;

[Table 2](https://preview.redd.it/0ejxho91h4xa1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cebbda436a96680abe187401e99f6c0936a3da84)

According to the Financial Times on February 28th, 2023, “More than a trillion dollars of risky US corporate loans are still tethered to LIBOR just four months before (expiration)”. Per FT, only “about 25 percent of the $1.4 Trillion US ‘junk’ loan market has switched”. Why? Because borrowers and investors are fighting over how such a switch should be approached. For reference, this is the comparison of the 1 month USD LIBOR rate as opposed to the SOFR interest rate (Table 2). What can be seen here is that there is a discrepancy between SOFR and USD LIBOR, a discrepancy borrowers and investors are trying to resolve. Some borrowers are fighting for as little as a .1% adjustment. The current recommendation from the Fed panel is a .26% adjustment. Table 2 shows that while the overnight USD LIBOR rate sits at \~4.55%, the 3 month LIBOR sits at \~4.91%. as of 11:39 GMT on Thursday, March 16th, 2023. This is a high stakes game of financial chicken. The potential global implications are real. They are systemic.

I am not a professional; I cannot predict the future. However, one can theoretically bet on just about everything. If it exists, someone somewhere is probably willing to take a wager on it. One lesson that is learned early on in gambling is that the house always wins. The only problem is that this is not the reality. Counting cards is positive expected value (+EV). Playing poker can also be +EV when playing Game Theory Optimal (GTO) or exploitatively in a certain pool of players (“individual actors”). Sports betting can also be profitable, +EV. Even slot machines, when played correctly, can be played at advantage, +EV.

Let me make this clear. I am not advocating any one individual to “bet” on this scenario. In roulette, there are two versions; European and American. The difference is that, in American roulette, there are two 0’s; 0 and 00. In European roulette, there is a single 0. The corresponding house edge in American and European roulette is 5.26% and 2.70%, respectively, when betting on any single number. I know which table I would sit at; neither. But this is all theory; in a casino, you eventually lose everything. Unless it is done correctly. That is the end of the theoreticals.

Part II: The Reason

Disclaimer: Not a financial adviser

One should have an understanding of the previous article, and look towards how compensation is paid out private v. public.

An economic fact is that public sector employees are compensated better, in terms of dollars, than private sector employees.  

[Table 1](https://preview.redd.it/osk8cluyi3xa1.png?width=2742&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=796c2efa193a91003bde86575bb4d5aa899e2d54)

A few comparisons of note include total compensation disparities, percentage and cost of total benefits disparities, as well as retirement and savings percentage disparities (Source:Bureau of Labor Statistics; Accessed Dec. 23, 2022). 

This does not mean that private sector employees “save” less, only that public sector employees receive more in the form of compensated savings, as well as total benefits overall. This is not an article on benefits, but rather a focus on savings and retirement. (Added: Teachers receive the most compensated retirements and savings out of all occupations shown above). Where do these retirement and savings go? 

For the private sector:

&#x200B;

[Table 3](https://preview.redd.it/7gc1gpapj3xa1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d3ae0c8d1f8af2a9cfb7ceb6446ce600d762b43)

Defined benefit is more akin to a 401k, while defined contribution is more akin to a pension. (Edited: This was corrected before publication).

The point being that the savings of public sector employees is often more “directed” than private sector employees. One example is the California State Teachers Retirement System, a public pension fund with a set asset return rate of 7% (Source: California State Teachers Retirement System, Bill: SB868). Per their website, they are the second largest public pension fund in the nation (CalSTRS “About CalSTRS” Accessed Dec. 23, 2022). Table 1 (left) is the portfolio composition of CalSTRS.

The largest investment category is Public Equity. As of 1:30 a.m. GMT December 24, 2022, a benchmark ETF for the S&P500 has returned -18.29% annually (Source: Robinhood; Ticker SPY). A benchmark ETF for the NASDAQ has returned -32.23% annually (Source: Robinhood; Ticker QQQ). The next largest two categories are real estate and private equity. The fourth largest category is fixed income: Bonds.

My question is what happens in a scenario where real estate enters a correction, and public equities stay depressed. Private equity is difficult to value, and tends to do best in environments of low interest rates/stock market growth (Source: Investopedia, “Private Equity Explained…”). Fixed income generally doesn’t have a superior yield, but is widely considered a safe and stable investment vehicle. But with interest rates on the rise, what happens to retroactively low face value fixed income instruments? The coupon on a 30-year fixed 02/15/2051 T-Bond is 1.8750%.

One can look into the actual bonds held by this pension fund example. It’s all public information. And that’s the extent of the public story.

Betting on 00: A Story About Debt

Part I: The Setup

Let me start this out by saying that I hope I’m wrong. This isn’t my story, but a shared story.

[Graph 1](https://preview.redd.it/j0gdivaki2xa1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=913d5dbcb2ca2b561f5077bbc5c97c19da7673c0)

As you can see from the graph (Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury, St. Louis Fed; Accessed Dec. 24, 2022), federal debt held by the public has risen from near 0 in the early 1970’s ($372.0 Billion Q1 1970) to astronomical ($30.93 Trillion Q3 2022) in the present. The gray shaded areas indicate economic recessions. Of note is what has occurred in the previous two economic recessions as compared to recessions of the further past. Taking a look at the graph, during the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-induced recession, the slope of the debt graph is much more steep. This is opposed to previous economic recessions, where the slope does not see such sharp spikes. Essentially, the rate at which public debt is being created is accelerating, and is exacerbated in recent times of economic stress. The straight line is what the federal debt held by the public would have been, had the rate of debt increased in a linear fashion.

To my second point:

&#x200B;

[Graph 2](https://preview.redd.it/dvjuy847j2xa1.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e27eaa25bc66cb7c5fb1e6f0e9153253f8ededa)

This graph, from the same source, illustrates total public debt as a function of the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). What this graph shows is that, since about 1980, this ratio has expanded. While there is a drop from Q3 1995 to Q2 2001, the trend remains the same; the ratio of debt:GDP has steadily increased since the 1980’s. This is important in light of the economic analysis done by Lyn Alden (Source needed; non-public) that 51out of 52 nations that have crossed the threshold of 130% debt:GDP ratio have defaulted. (Image source: Hirshman Capital):

&#x200B;

[Table 1](https://preview.redd.it/ezb9n7hej2xa1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb2f77ba89b69b589057b74fa5c5337ec3323c04)

The United States crossed this threshold Q2 2020, during the 2020 COVID-induced recession. It is interesting to note that half of such national defaults have been attributed to war.

Finally, some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on employment costs; focus on the public sector compensation increase from 2009 to present day, in both absolute and percentage terms (delta), as compared to the private sector. The units are real, but arbitrary.

The rate at which benefits are increasing for public sector workers vastly outweighs compensation in the private sector, in both percentage and absolute terms. Where does this compensation go? And more importantly, how is it funded?

$STNE ; I am up 25% off of 45k. Good luck regards

The fintech industry in Brazil has been growing rapidly over the past few years, with a wide range of innovative companies offering various financial products and services to consumers and businesses. This is due to several favorable factors, such as a large population, growing middle class, and high smartphone penetration, which provide ample opportunities for fintech companies to expand their user base and drive adoption.

What this means is that Brazil has a significant potential for fintech companies to disrupt traditional financial services and offer new and innovative solutions. This is an exciting and dynamic space with significant growth potential.

StoneCo is a Brazilian fintech company that provides payment processing, financial software, and other services to businesses in Brazil. It is one of the most successful fintech companies in Brazil, with a strong growth trajectory since its founding in 2012.

In October 2018, StoneCo went public on the NASDAQ, raising over $1.2 billion in its initial public offering. This means that StoneCo became a publicly traded company, and investors could buy shares of the company.

Since then, StoneCo has continued to expand its offerings, acquiring other companies and investing in new technology and infrastructure. This is a positive sign of the company's continued growth and success.

StoneCo's success is tied to the broader thesis that the fintech industry in Brazil has significant potential for growth and innovation. This is because Brazil is a ripe market for fintech companies to offer new and innovative solutions due to its large and growing population, increasing smartphone adoption, and a supportive regulatory environment.

Furthermore, StoneCo's success has helped to validate the potential of the Brazilian fintech market, attracting increased investment and interest from both domestic and international investors. This means that other fintech companies may also benefit from this trend and drive significant value for their stakeholders.

StoneCo’s growth is insane, this sets it apart from the rest.

The new president of Brazil is fighting the Central Banks (traditional banks) and legislation has been pushed back to benefits growth of fintech companies.

By investing in Buffets secret Easter egg, that I even believe he is underestimating, you are betting on the future of Brazilian fintech. After everything I’ve looked into, this is why I believe it’s a solid choice.

132f1re,DD,"Sell in May and Go away? Banking Crisis take two, FOMC, calendar of events and VIX 52W low … 4-28-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Weekly Market","Well most of us who have been trading for a while know that yesterdays technical defying rally was and should be seen as the exception not the normal… However, back to back moves like this is exactly what this market does to try and convince people this is the new normal “just by calls and let it ride.”

However, I am the first one here to say that this is not the normal and thinking that you can just buy calls and let them ride all day to be immensely rewarded will leave you and your port burned out by the end of next week if you even make it that long. 

We got a lot to unpack here…

**Sell in may and go away**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1cr88m02qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4328183a3dc295733e098022e14230b17877641

If you have been around trading for any amount of time you know that historically speaking we end up with articles saying to sell in May and buy back in October. What I find hilarious if you type in “stocks sell in may” to google right now these are the first two article that pop up… The Media has a way of not only keeping us on our toes and they also have a way of shaping the narrative to fit their needs. 

**Bank Crisis** 

If this feels like déjà vu to you well it should… why? Because guess when the last bank collapse happened? It happened the week before FOMC (relatively speaking)… And now the quiet week right before FOMC what do we have? We have FRC officially going under… Officially as of EOD here we are with FRC being taken over by the government and going into receivership. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sb5r4k212qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bbbd85dc645eb5f7f4352acbdd49980cae0ba646

If you traded today then you saw the massive market drop we had from 1030 until 11am… At that point you would have thought it was over for the bulls and that market much like in March with the SVB issues would see a huge drop and that would be it for the bulls… 

However, we regained strength and some how managed to continue to push up EOD. This further fits not my theory I mentioned last night that I truly believe this is a run for the exit and retail is being left as the exit liquidity. 

I have two questions… whos next (bank wise)? And how does this effect FOMC next week? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjnvcxq12qwa1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57eb264aa37d0e76df84491e278efac1a69b9215

So now JPOW is in a REALLY tough place here… why? Well he has to now answer for how SVB and FRC are both outliers and there contagion hasn’t truly set in now… The next question is that last FOMC jpow DID consider a pause but they still went ahead and got did a 25bps rate hike… 

JPOW also mentioned that rate hikes is still his base case… meaning he expects to continue to hike and definitely is not planning to pause…

FOMC Wednesday is likely to be very spicy… 

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ie86w522qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d9fba64e599491ea385ea89e66369d99cc56826f

Now unless you have been living under a rock… you know that FOMC is next Wednesday May 3rd. Now we also have ADP non farm, and PMI… So lets talk about it… whats the expectation for FOMC on Wednesday? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gkh2t5i22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0781278e3e0e36698389ed017ad133a33739e7c7

This week saw a peak expectation of at 89.1% chance of a 25bps on Wednesday… however, today with seemingly the news from FRC we saw that number drop down to 80.@ as of EOD. 

For me I am fairly confident JPOW is going to do a 25bps rate hike and I am also fairly confident that despite what happens over the weekend with FRC we are going to see him stick to the script that inflation is still too hot and has not properly come down yet, he is also going to once again re-iterate that rate cuts is NOT the base case and that the fed does NOT expect a pause by EOY. 

The question we are faced with this time… will the markets believe him or not? 

There absolutely is a base case where the market shrugs him off once again and pushes this higher until we get a true CPI rebound (possibly the following week) that then “shocks” the market. However, IF we finally see market and price this in correctly for the first time since March we might finally see not only a sell off but a sustained sell off in the markets. 

**Calendar of Events**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yynv2ry22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92c6e2abe32677ce67ad0d7673e0ec979aba276b

From a calendar of events stand point we have a banger of week ahead data wise… 

Monday starts us off with more PMI data, followed by Tuesday with JOLTS, then of course Wednesday is ADP, more PMI and FOMC, we immediately follow up the fireworks on Wednesday with challenger jobs, and unemployment claims, then we finish the week out with the all important unemployment rate and our first fed speaker Cook post FOMC. 

Pre Markets next week are likely to be extremely volatile and unpredictable. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/av11ere32qwa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05fda32e6a3911b5700d95f9054c9823de79ec4c

Alright lets get into the technical now. 

After establishing a new demand (support) yesterday at 404.3 I was wondering if we might see a push up to 414.22 to take out that demand before starting our next leg down. I did not expect us to push through that and break through 415.25 supply. We had a pretty large fight at 415.25 most of the day and for a lot of the day until the huge EOD push up it looked like that was our line in the sand. 

However, we have now found ourselves wondering if we are going to push higher through 417.03 supply or if we found ourselves back in the daily range. If we do push higher here we have a huge gap from 417.03 to 429.8 with no major levels in between. 

**SPY Weekly SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ve5mmwt32qwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b4c5beecb0fccfbfaa225dfabf05998dd716c97

This is where things get a little interesting here and honestly the more I look at it the more the weekly looks like we might actually have a huge blow off top push to 427.53 before we finally come cratering down. 

Last week we put in a new supply. Doing so allowed us to come down and take out previous 409.98 supply. What is incredible and extremely unexpected is that we actually in the process of all of that turned weekly supply at 412.66 into a weekly demand now at 411.87. 

It should definitely be noted this is what I would call a “weak” demand (support), however, it is definitely not something we can ignore. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ntl1nvb42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00f8916e19fd456bf0a9d1795d3666be0f5cb297

Now what really is impressive here is how fast this recovered this week. Two days ago I wouldn’t have expected to close over 405.2 let alone all the way back over 415… 

As you can see we actually do find ourselves in a broad black bull channel once again and we have ourselves in a 3 day long intense red bull channel. 

When we loss 405.2 I would have expected a continuation back down to 390.1, however, we actually found ourselves bouncing aggressively off the daily 50ema and retaking the daily 8/20ema. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fqspads42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=821780086cb34f55ab7ef0dcd2bbfcc6753672da

Looking at the weekly price action objectively here we after closing three doji candles in a row we actually just closed out a massive bearish hanging man candle… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lskbyl852qwa1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4ce1621050eceb24c329a7d405a025d5ad596e8

Now as you can see one could assume that this IS the top… however, that would mean that we are trading based on sound technicals and logic. Or perhaps this is a preamble to whats going to happen after FOMC. However, we definitely have to take in to consideration the fact that we did drop and bounce off the weekly 20/50ema… 

Honestly as much as I am bearish long term… it is very hard not to feel bullish looking at this here. So lets talk about it…

From a bullish stand point today we bounced off the daily 8ema and confirmed it as support today. Since we bounced back inside the 405.2 to 419.5 channel the natural upside target here should be 419.5. not only that we did close over the march 18th 415.6 candle high just barely… but in doing so we should open ourselves up for more upside. 

From a bearish stand point we are coming into the upper end of our range here and resistance where bears have their highest opportunity and chance to reject. The one thing I have noticed lately on SPY is that we go on these sell offs that then lead into massive 2 days rallies that make absolutely no sense form a technical stand point… the most recent example is March 15th/ 16th and March 2nd and 3rd.

Now the question is which case is stronger here… from a macro economical/ data stand point we should see our top here and we should start our next leg down… however, from a daily technical stand point here as long as we hold this daily 8ema honestly its very hard for me to not want to feel bullish and start looking for a rally to 420+ into FOMC. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 427.5  
 Demand- 411.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.3 -> 404.2  
 Resistance- 416.1 -> 422

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/whbp74u52qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5aea334263ba01f965a43e8a3c9db58d138f20d3

Now on futures daily supply and demand here there is no change on futures… we bounced off 4085 demand and established that two days ago and now we are attempting to push through 4178 and follow through 4198 supply. 

If we can break through 4198 supply then much like SPY we have a pretty large push up to 4310 without much levels in between. 

One thing to point out here on futures daily is the volatility (relatively speaking using an indicator) we have put in back to back high volatility bars. Now the last time we did this (put in a high volatility bar let alone more then one) was March 10th to March 20th…. We actually put 7 high volatility bars in a row in… and what happened then? Well you guess it… we put the bottom of the sell off in and then went on a month plus long rally. 

So the theory would be here with this high volatility that we are nearing the top and we should be nearing the temporary top. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6g96bob62qwa1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9a3407522778a81db1da604c33ee6cb905de659

Now this is where we actually find ourselves in a much different place on Futures then we do on SPY…. Futures did not establish a new demand and it also did not come down low enough to 4055 to take out previous weekly supply. 

However, this is where we have found ourselves in a massive weekly imbalance… we are seeing ourselves establishing a weekly demand and then immediately turning around to close over that weekly supply… that show an incredible imbalance that will need to be reconciled by either a massive flush back under this 4173 supply or a large enough push up towards that 4283 supply that we can turn 4173 into a demand (much like spy did). 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kh1kxft62qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e99928fcfe239f55985f5c2e1d957aeeecb3a08d

Now on a daily stand point here for Futures we find ourselves in a place much like SPY… a massively broad 2 month long black bull channel followed by a huge extreme red bull channel. 

The question would be are we on a path up to that 4250- 4300 area or have we found ourselves actually finding the top? I hate that we are truly each day left with more questions than answers… 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y36m9y972qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d21a97172825afca4e9a8cd1c739221235ae60da

Futures did not quite break through the wick tops of the January/ February highs, however, we also closed out a massive hanging man bearish reversal weekly candle here too… This one was however, bullish engulfing… 

Again far more questions than true answers and sense of direction… I truly hope that FOMC provides not only direction but sense of answers and clarity. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4174 -> 4284  
 Demand-3919  
 Support- 4149 -> 4095  
 Resistance-4190 -> 4220 -> 4280

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/opo4rrt72qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38bc377e57d86398d3b0d8f19e415b0fba8c58da

The one question I think we ask ourselves every single day… IS the VIX broken? My answer is yes but only when it wants to be…

So lets pain the picture here… This week (and today) we got data that suggested inflation has not cooled, we got data that suggested a recession is upon us, we got data that suggested the economy remains far too strong (remember strong economy the harder and longer JPOW can rate hike), not only that we witness yet another bank (this time the 14th largest) officially go under, and we have one of the most important fed events in less than three trading days (FOMC). 

Now despite all of this… the VIX (which remembers shows you the voaltility of longer 28+ dte options) decided it was going to not only put in a 52 week low but an almost 18 month LOW for the VIX… 

From low to high over the last 3 days the VIX has unwound nearly 20%. Absolutely insane when you look at what is coming up over the next two weeks and not only that everything we got data wise this week.

Truly I just can not for the life of me fathom why the VIX is behaving like this and I truly can not really imagine a world where no one feels the need to put on long term downside protection… 

I mean look at that massive spike in March with the last time we got the same banking information… why are we not seeing a similair reaction? 

**WEEKLY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

Todays trading started out much like yesterday but honestly it was even more extreme during opening hour… I truly cant remember the last time we ran $3 up during opening hour let alone during the first 30 minutes of the day. 

Thankfully I was able to make some money on some scalps and then it pretty much all went down hill from there… we had that huge reaction to the FRC data and that’s where everything went wonky… market couldn’t decide if we were going to melt down like march or if we were going to ATH… after getting absolutely massacred I was able to crawl back to some decent profits to close out the day. 

I think what is most frustrating over the last two weeks is that I have had incredibly profitable Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays and then end up unfortunately giving back some of it on Thursdays and Fridays. 

One interesting trend that I am monitoring on my weekly logs is that for 2023 my win rate has dropped almost 20-30% since January, however, despite a rough February my profitability remains the same. The question would be why? One thing that I have noticed lately over the last 2-3 weeks is that I am allowing myself to take far more entries then every before (or perhaps im just getting more entries). I have noticed that if the entry criteria is there then I take the play… however, sometimes that obviously doesn’t play out. One thing I have also noticed is that I am far quicker to stop myself out then ever before. All in all a good week of trading and profits though.

131q61y,DD,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

## Trading Thesis - Feast Your Eyes on the Tastiest Crayons 🖍️

Just like Vanellope's candy-coated racecar dashes across Sugar Rush, technical analysis zooms through past prices to predict the sweet spots of today. 🚗💨

My top-secret recipe for predicting winning plays involves blending option open interest with a sprinkle of Delta and Gamma greeks. Presto! We get tantalizing price levels where volatility is juiciest and the market hovers near equilibrium. Talk about a sugar rush! 😋

Sometimes, the underlying price dances around like a sugarplum fairy, reacting to delta neutrality or maximum gamma. My magical trading signals spring from the past reactions to these prices that put you in the fast lane to success. 🏁

To make your wallet sweeter, I whip up plays and target entry prices using a binomial option pricing model. It's like a candy-factory conveyor belt, spewing out profit, direction and increased IV! 🍭

## Notes - The Perfect Recipe for Trading Brain Gains 🧠💡

* If the price has zipped past the entry, beware! It means the market gobbled up the goodies before you took a bite.
* Grab half your winnings when you double, and ride the sugar-high of the rest at your leisure. 🍬
* I'm the careful candy-maker, only risking 1% of my fortune on trades, and going even lighter when I'm less sure of success. 🍫
* These scrumptious trades are based on yesterday's intel, so chew on that when jumping in late. Don't let fresh price moves spoil the confectionery goodness. 🍪

## FAQ - Common Sweet Inquiries 🍩🍬

* Focused on puts, are you a 🏳️‍🌈🐻?
  * Nope, not a gay bear! Some companies are just overhyped, like sugar-free candy. These trades help bring 'em back down to earth (or a more reasonable price level). 🌟

   * Nuh-uh! I'm sharing a candy box of opportunities so everyone can indulge in gainz glory. Pick your favorites from this smorgasbord, and see which ones turn you into a cash-making-machine! 💰🍡
* What if there's a new play for the same ticker? 🤷♂️
   * Then learn from Sugar Rush - embrace the new and ditch the old! Don't chase past glories, stay fresh and savor the now. 🕰️

Now I have a theory… and its definitely a theory but if you stay with me here you may see where im going with this… 

Lets think about what we have coming up over the next two weeks… FOMC next week followed by CPI the following week. 

Now this is gonna be a long winded message and if you just want the TA skip below. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ljk3avziwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c35e0e96ae160b5cb224d9d4049c3345df7df3d1

This is from the CMEgroup which many say to be the most accurate representation of future fed funds rates… 

Lets take a look at what I highlighted here… current fed funds rate is 475-500 and by new week that will as of right now 90% chance be 500-525… 

What I want to point out here is that we actually just with that GDP data saw a huge shift in the forecasted market. Now look at what happened over night… we went from a 26% chance of 450-475 rate/ 40.2% chance of 425-450 rate to currently now a 48% chance of 450-475 and 30.2% chance of 425-450…

What does this mean? This means that we actually just saw over night the market go from pricing in 75bps of rate CUTS by the end of the year to now only pricing in 50 bps of rate CUTS by the end of year… 

Now last time I checked the market has always seen rate cuts as bullish and rate hikes as bearish… actually what is even more impressive is that over the last month we went from an expected 35.9% chance of 400-425 fed funds rate EOY (aka 100bps of rate CUTS) to where we currently are as mentioned ago… that means FINALLY the market is actually starting to believe jpow… 

Now this is where im pure speculating and spit balling my theory here… what if markets really didn’t believe JPOW last fomc? What if we ran up in hopes that JPOW was wrong and that we would actually cut 100bps… well in less than a week JPOW is going to stand up there and tell the markets “im hiking 25bps and once again as I said last meeting our base case is NO rate CUTS this year.” Now this time markets are going to start to believe him… 

Then what happens next? Well we get CPI and boy do I think we get some CPI fireworks… look at the price of OIL alone and the fact that current forecasts are for an unchanged YOY CPI/ CORE. Why does that matter? Well after 9 consecutive months of downward trending CPI we finally are about to stall/ rebound. What is that going to do? Well that is going to cause even more panic… why? Simple… JPOW absolutely can not (outside of an actual black swan market crash) stop rate hikes if inflation rebounds or even just slows its downward trend. 

When inflation is unchanged or more likely rebounds on May 10th markets gonna panic… but I think they already know this… they are going to have to with no choice price in even less rate cuts by EOY if not more rate HIKES by EOY… 

So the question would be why did SPY just put in the biggest green day in over 3 months on seemingly extremely bearish new that is staring us down right now? Its simple… market needs exit liquidity… Today is going to be the highest volume bull day since March 31st. In my opinion and theory markets know May is going to be a very bearish month and that we are going to see a true drop (think 380-390)… right now we are seeing this push back up into the consolidation range for a few reasons… 1. Burn as many people already short (remember market is apparently the most net short since 2008) before the drop happens. 2. Big money needs to exit their longs and shares that they bought from 410-418 and 3. Big money is trying to get the best price they can on shorts. 

In no way should the VIX have dropped nearly 10% on the data and news we got this morning and not with what the market priced in with the fed funds rate… This is a fake rally in my opinion. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/144zb3ojwhwa1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0ab5ac4958689ba6039f3656d548d1af6ee2878

From a supply and demand stand point we had a pretty killer and wild day… We had a lot of changes… 

We officially established a new demand (support) at 404.3 and in doing do pushed up to take our 406.74 and 409.18 demand. 

In addition we pushed up all the way to 412.62 supply and had a pretty solid rejection off of it. 

I see two scenarios playing out here… first scenario is that tomorrow we will push up to touch 414.22 demand (to take it out) but close back under 412.62 which should reconfirm that level as supply (resistance) that would then pave way for a push back to 404.3 demand and possibly down to 399.07 supply next week. Or the second scenario would be that we just immediately turn around and sell off back under the daily 8/20ema tomorrow which most likely would result in 412.62 being reconfirmed as supply (resistance) 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8t7a7r2kwhwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b579dcb4c265cf20e5f0699c7281071193227229

Now on SPY here price action wise this was quite the reversal and really did put a stop to the bears right in their tracks… The biggest and most bullish thing I see here is that we came up and retook the daily 8 and 20ema… While it is possible we could immediately double top tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema by EOD… more likely than not this shows a pattern of continuation to the upside for tomorrow. 

Looking at this realistically we have now established a new range of 404.3 to 415.6. Upside should continue to be limited right around the 414 to 416 area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jvukdyikwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2af13696c1d0162a86a8a2a23bd4cfac2995def4

We do get some more data in the morning which will be interesting to watch play out and how markets receive this data…. I honestly don’t have a high sense of direction for tomorrow but I wouldn’t be surprised to see an attempt to touch and take out that 414.22 demand we left above… doing so really would open up a lot more down side possibilities. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 412.6 -> 415.4  
 Demand- 414.2  
 Support- 410.6 -> 409.2 -> 406.9  
 Resistance- 412.6 -> 414.1 -> 415.2

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v67q9ykwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8e5af005dcf3bb8b1b09fef3bfee36f3ac684ac6

Futures daily also had some re-arranging today. We put in a new demand (support) at 4085 and have push up to take out 4117 demand. We now are currently sitting just over 4158 supply with the next supply at 4178 and 4198. 

Much of the same here on Futures as SPY I do see a case to immediately turn around to reconfirm 4158 as supply (resistance) with a double top drop…. But I also see a case for push back up to 4178/4198 supplies first before we eventually push back down to 4085 demand and eventually 4040/4055 supply. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s932s7elwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5c73f8feb19ec0d6745d67df75b2bba5420ce8f

Much of the same here we came down here and double bottomed nicely off 4085. In doing so we retook the daily 8/ 20ema and retook critical level of 4095. 

With the current down trend broken we should expect this 4085 to 4178 range to be our new range until fomc or something else breaks that trend. As of right now the closer we get to 4178 the more bearish we should find ourselves. 

I do believe we will continue this run up tomorrow but I believe we are just being presented and even better short opportunity for summer time.

Futures Daily Level  
 Supply- 4158 -> 4178  
 Demand- 4085  
 Support- 4138 -> 4110 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4158 -> 4178

**VIX1D**

The VIX1D actually gets its own section today because it was so intriguing to me as while we only have now 4 total days of data… todays the first day that didn’t make sense to me. 

The VIX1D, or the 1-Day Volatility Index, measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 Index for the current trading day.Taking an aggregated measurement of weighted prices across one- and zero-day P.M. settled SPX option expirations, the VIX1D calculates its value of expected volatility, according to the Cboe’s press release. Simply put, the VIX1D reflects the midpoint values of weekly SPX put and call prices for today and the next day in real-time. 

So that’s the definition of apparently what the VIX1D measures.. now lets look at the VIX1D today… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kda0aewlwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f1c5d392b3f548a99e998dc001fa372e0c0ebe6

This is VIX1D on a 5min chart with HA candles on the left and standard candles on the right… what does this price action show all day? Well it showed that the VIX1D had a MASSIVE drop over night (at open… remember vix1d closes at 415pm and opens at 930am which I still think it should be the same hours as the regular VIX). After the massive gap down what did it to? It rose all day long and aggressively rose all day long.

Now why is that odd? Well lets think about this the same way we think about the regular VIX… if we watched the VIX gap down about 30% at open only to close up 11.29% by the EOD what would you expect the price of SPY to do? You would 100% expect it to have a massive drop. And if it didn’t what would you expect? Well you would expect that there is a massive imbalance somewhere and that something isn’t correlating correctly…

So I see two ways this fixes itself… we either 1. Have a massive melt down on SPY tomorrow to catch up to VIX1d or 2. We have a massive correction to the downside on VIX1D which then causes an even bigger rally on SPY tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/67049ibmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35e3cdcbb103f75f9abab9cfb3e5c9e221bec71b

Currently I am in the process of tracking VIX1D and finding a correlation… I am not using Mondays data as its not helpful for me and my analysis so I only have 2 days of data… so far what I have seen is that IF the 4pm to 415pm move on VIX1D is down (so the 415pm close is lower than 4pm opening on candle) SPY will open green the next day (no correlation on how green yet). I also see a correlation that IF the VIX1D closes HIGHER the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES red… IF the VIX1D closes LOWER than the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES Green… 

So if we look at this trend and data so far… we should see a green open on SPY followed by a red close… now of course two days of data is hardly anything to take a trade off but I continue to track this and plan to track this for the foreseeable future and analyze IF we can make a predictive guess…

But I share this data now because if that’s the case and data holds true we are actually setting up for a massive red day tomorrow with how aggressive the VIX1D rallied. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ecgugpmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6af05cf1b69e9c6c89386be4d6f68ea716324554

Now this is where I continue to be a little dumbfounded… I see zero basis for why the VIX would be down 9.66% today based on the GDP data and the change in the EOY fed funds rate expectations… We should have seen a continuation on the VIX to the upside… however, that’s not what we got and we now find ourselves back in this red channel from 15.05 to 17.1. 

This also brings us back under the daily 8ema/ 20ema. 

Now the question and the data I will be taking from today is does the VIX outweigh price action on SPY compared to VIX1D… as in does a massive red day on VIX mean more than a massive green day on VIX1D. 

I also can not for the life of me understand while the VIX would drop 9.66% (meaning there is now less 28dte+ long term puts than yesterday) when a recession is pretty much imminent and the actual chances of a fed pause grow further and further away. There is a severe imbalance here.

Today was an absolutely frustrating day… took a small loss on a meta put which im not even upset about… 

But intraday trading today was absolutely frustrating and at times senseless… It felt like almost all day we were set up for clear cut bearish movements. However, what we found was pushes to the upside just continued…. The hardest part about today was that I recognized we were in extreme bull momentum for most of the day and I even tried a few times to get in on calls (actually loss on a few or took profits too early) however the technical never set up for an entry… and by time it actually set up for a call entry it had already moved.

Today was a lesson in a few things… 1. NEVER and I mean NEVER fight extreme momentum no matter how good a play works (I struggle with this ever day like this)…. 2. We do not need to trade every single day… recognize the days that are advantageous to your strategy and capitalize on those… sit out the rest… 3. There will be days that are the exception to the rule… that doesn’t mean we change our rules to fit that day… it’s the exception not the rule. 

I am still thankfully sitting at my weekly profit goal overall right now but today took a huge chunk out of my weekly profits. Today was a frustrating day and one that you look back and say well obviously it was easy… just buy a call at hold it all day… well sure everything is easy when you look back… but for anyone who uses any sort of technical analysis or price action reading or anything outside of FOMO…. Today was anything but easy. 

Remember… tomorrows a new day and we have 252 trading days a year… we don’t have to trade every day… also have a set amount every day that if you lose $xxx then you stop for the day and come back the next day… one of the worst thing someone can do is continue to trade on a day that’s not made for their strategy and eat way and weeks or months of profit.",DaddyDersch,104,0.89,95,0,0,95,11,2023-04-27T21:31:48Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1317xu1/i_have_a_theory_that_this_was_a_run_for_the_exit/

1310clx,DD,Your lotto play for AMZN's earnings tonight,"So yesterday I told everyone to buy [META calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) before earnings and it was a straight banger with the stock up 15% after earnings. The day before? [MSFT earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/), posted it before market close. Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector. We want to know if daddy Bezos can maintain his strong momentum.

I expect the company to top the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. Amazon outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 9% to $149.2 billion. It was due to a 13% rise in North America revenues and a 20% improvement in the Amazon web services segment. That said, the positive impact was partially offset by an 8% drop in international division revenues. I fully expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.

Trefis estimates Amazon’s valuation at [$134 per share](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/p5DVYQLL/Amazon-AMZN-Valuation-Is-AMZN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427), which is 22% above the current market price of around $110. 

**Revenues expected to top the estimates**

[Amazon’s revenues grew 9% y-o-y](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/HcytK2Km/Amazon-Revenues-How-Does-AMZN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427) to $514 billion in FY2022.

* The company witnessed positive growth in net revenues from physical stores (11%), third-party seller services (14%), subscription services (11%), advertising services (21%), and AWS (29%) divisions. We expect the same pattern to continue in Q1.
* The net sales from the online stores category marginally decreased in the year to $220 billion. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1.
* Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $560 billion for the full-year 2023.

The estimates follow that Amazon’s fiscal Q1 2023 net revenues to be around $125.99 billion, slightly above the $124.54 billion consensus estimate.

**EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates**

Amazon Q1 2023 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22, 5% above the consensus estimate of $0.21. The adjusted net income decreased from $33.4 billion to -$2.7 billion in FY 2022. It was partly due to an increase in operating expenses and partly because of an unfavorable decrease in non-operating income from $13.3 billion to -$18.2 billion. Markedly, the non-operating income primarily suffered because of a pre-tax valuation loss from an equity investment in Rivian Automotive.

We expect the operating expenses to follow the same trend in Q1. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $1.71 and revenue per share of $55.44 for the full-year 2023.

**Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price**

Remember the $134 evaluation? This was using an RPS estimate of around $55.44 and a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just above 2x in fiscal 2023. This translates into a price of $134, which is 31% above the current market price. Note that P/E Multiples are based on Share Price at the end of the year and reported (or expected) Adjusted Earnings for the full year.

**What do other Finance Websites Say?**

[TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/) also expects Amazon to post strong results. They report that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is likely to remain a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue.

[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) predicts that Amazon's first-quarter earnings will be driven by its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also notes that AWS (Amazon Web Services) is expected to post revenue of $14.03 billion, representing a YoY increase of 28.6%. 

[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) mentions that in response to an uncertain macro backdrop, management has implemented some aggressive cost-saving measures to boost both profitability and its margin profile. These measures include shutting down unprofitable businesses, reducing its global headcount and reprioritizing resources in an effort to right-size the business. The goal is for amazon (like meta) to emerge leaner and stronger. 

For those who don't know the [Tastylive website](https://www.tastylive.com/), they've also provided a comprehensive preview of Amazon's earnings report, highlighting the company's ability to beat expectations in the past. Amazon has a history of surpassing Wall Street's earnings estimates, and it is expected to continue this trend in Q1 2023. However, they also mention potential challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that could impact the company's financial performance.

**Amazon Earnings Expected Move**

Take a look at the implied volatility of the options market, we can see what the market perception is on AMZN’s stock price movement going forward. With an expected move of ±$6.55, we are looking at just over a 5% expected move on the current stock price for this earnings announcement, which is not necessarily high for a household name like Amazon. If we were to look further into the June cycle though, we can see that this ±$6.55 expected move makes up over 60% of the June cycle’s expected move, which is a substantial chunk given the circumstances.

AMZN stock is currently trading around $110, and we can see that equidistant out-of-the-money options for the weekly options cycle are trading for around the same price - this tells us that the market is not pricing in any sort of skew for this announcement, which is a perceived high-velocity movement. This basically (unfortunately) offers no indication on whether it's going to move up or down. However, given all the details above, what do *you* think? No seriously, take a moment to think about the information presented before you continue reading and try to think: calls or puts for earnings? We do know that with the stock currently at $110, Amazon's risk-versus-reward profile suggests the stock could produce strong returns in the next 12 to 18 months. *But what about earnings??*

**What to do for today's Earnings**

Given all the considerations above, it would be an absolute degen play to even bother considering going into Amazon for earnings. (Oh.. who am I kidding?( Let's fucking go for it! AMZN 4/28 call spread is looking juicy. Can buy the 115c and sell the 120c for $122. This can offer 4.1x gains if things go our way. Mind you, this is not financial or investment advice - this post is just offering education based on what people tend to look for in a company to make an earnings prediction.

130kodf,DD,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

130et38,DD,HUGE smoking gun for FRC collapse,"Big banks must come together to save FRC. It’s FRC’s best hope at preventing collapse. However the Australian Financial Review published this MASSIVE smoking gun and nobody is talking about it: 

“executives at five of the biggest banks, speaking on the condition they not be named, dismissed the notion of once again banding together to prop up First Republic, especially when it could mean paving the way for investors or a competitor to scoop up the firm at a bargain price.

One expressed a willingness to participate – only if regulators forced the group to take action.

**Several banks would prefer that, if it becomes necessary, the FDIC seize First Republic and sell it off. Such a resolution, they said, would be cleaner, even if banks lose money. Some have already taken reserves.**”

The government has already said they will not aid in rescue. Big banks apparently are unwilling to help as well. The only possible outcome is a seizure by the FDIC this weekend. 

Even if a rescue plan is agreed upon, shareholders are going to be left with nothing. This is a lose lose situation.

130cvgu,DD,Discover the Untapped Potential of Brazil's Largest Mining Company with a 30% Upside: Vale,"Hey guys, how are you doing?

Greetings from Brazil! :)

I'm sending this message to inform you about the movement of an old stock that is also traded in the United States and is presenting a 30% upside potential in the next 6-10 months.

The company is called Vale (its ticker in the US is ""VALE"" (VALE S.A.). The company is the largest mining company in Brazil and the fourth largest in the world. Currently, it is being affected by the fluctuation that occurs every semester due to China - when they do not buy to regulate the price.

I will present to you some data that shows the solidity of the company and why it is a great opportunity stock and one of the whales of Brazil.

* We are going through a low in the price of iron ore, being negotiated at $100 dollars/ton. Vale's breakeven point is $30 dollars/ton.
* The company was founded in 1942, initially as a state-owned company, but it was privatized decades ago.
* Gross Margin: 49%
* Net Margin: 46%
* Dividend Yield: 5.71%
* Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 2.98
* Return on Equity: 59%
* Return on Assets: 25%
* The stock is being traded at $13 dollars, however, it is worth at least $16 dollars. Historically, it falls every 6 months - as I mentioned earlier, due to China and its price control.

It is truly a stock that is not just a promise, but a reality, going through its natural cycle. Well, that's the tip. The Brazilian market is heavily investing in this stock, precisely because of everything I informed you and because it is the largest exporter of ore in Brazil, one of our main commodities.

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Like Scooby Snacks 🖍️🍪

Jinkies! Technical analysis and indicator-based trading are like solving mysteries, using clues from the past to predict important price levels today. 🕵️‍♀️

In this groovy analysis, we'll dig into current option open interest like searching for a secret passage in a haunted mansion. By calculating portfolio-level greeks (say that five times fast!) such as Delta and Gamma, we can simulate the changes in greeks at different price points. Now, we're one step closer to unmasking the villain... or in our case, price levels with the highest gamma and delta around zero.🔍

Some tickers are like scrappy pups, reacting strongly to both delta neutral and gamma max. It's these past reactions that'll have us driving our Mystery Machine towards juicy trading signals. 🚐💰

The plays and target entry prices are as calculated as Velma's uncanny knack for finding clues, using a binomial option pricing model that reflects the expected size and duration of reactions from gamma max or delta neutral. Many of these plays profit from underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from directional moves as well as increased IV.

## Notes - Mind-bending mysteries to ponder 🤔

* If the price has zoomed past the entry price like the gang when they're late for a Scooby Snack break, watch out 🔎. Something changed between creating these plays and the market opening. 
* Sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest quicker than Fred can say ""trap time!"" ⏲️
* I risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades like a brave dog down a dark hallway. If my conviction wavers, I'll allocate only 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital and dollar cost average in.
* The trades were calculated before the market opened, so they're based on information up until yesterday. Keep this in mind when deciding to jump into the mystery well after the fact 🗓️

## FAQ - The gang's all-too-familiar inquiries 🕵️

* They're mostly puts. Are you a Gloomy Gus bear? 🐻
   * Nope! Companies may have some recent gains that suggest they're ripe for a mean-reverting move.
* Are you tackling all these mysteries? 🔦
   * No way, Jose! I'm sharing more plays with a spooky edge to help my fellow mystery-solving apes find some gain possibilities 🦍💰
* There's a new play on the same ticker? What's the sitch? 🚩
   * Ditch the old play! The new play has fresher data like Daphne's latest fashion line.
* But where are the crayons? 🖍️
   * Click the links above, silly!
* Was it back-tested? 🧪
   * You bet! Results give us a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a ghoulishly good win rate of 63% (± 7%).
* And the historical performance? 📊
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio stands at 1.85, boasting a win rate of 68%. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%.

12zyzqv,DD,The Weekly M bearish pattern continues to play out… 4-26-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Analysis (Bonus META Earnings),"For almost a month now I have been talking about this cup and handle that has been attempting to form… we officially are finally doing it… 

&#x200B;

This cup and handle is playing out beautifully which gives us a soft target of 402.6 for EOW. However, I continue to see a bigger downside target of 399. 

&#x200B;

While some say TA doesn’t work and that its all fake… analyzing the past can be predictive of the future… this is as of now playing out perfectly for the weekly close back under 407.3 which should start the next bigger leg down. 

**Calendar**

Tomorrow we get more jobless data and GDP… currently the alantafed nowcasts says GDP is going to take a huge hit tomorrow. If we take a huge hit GDP like that that could put us back on the path to see a recession by the EOY.

We are seeing a “beat” on META but if you read between the lines… this forward guidance is real dog water if you ask me. 

Im starting to remember why I just as a blanket statement refuse to play earnings… at least it was a small lotto and about 30% of it paid for when I repositioned. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

On a daily timeframe here we did have a 405.17 supply that we did come down to finally take out. We have officially cleared out all the supplies that were left down below except for one at 399.07… for me until we establish a new demand (support) my target will remain at 399.07. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e34qnyxbiawa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=75a74ace1b5d68b64e2550ef556dade287eca5df

One thing that I said I was looking for today was a bounce and retest of the daily 20ema… I actually expected us to put in a green day but instead we actually tested it and hard rejected and closed under critical support of 405.2… Now that we have closed under 405.2 we have a very clear move down to 399 and possibly 390.. the thing to know about SPY is that it is very consistent with its channels. What I mean is SPY likes its ranges… now that we have fallen out of the 405.2 to 420 range we should start re-considering the 390 to 405.2 range. 

We did come down and tested the daily 50ema support but held over that. Tomorrow my target is 399 which will get us under the daily 100/ 200ema… Historically speaking SPY does not like to move through the 200ema whether bullishly or bearishly without a fight. Meaning that when we do get to the 200ema that likely will be our bounce area and 399 is where I play to take profits on my 86dte 408P. 

We have officially started a resistance line down and will keep a close eye on that along with 405.2 and the daily 20ema. 

The question now is can this META “beat” actually hold SPY up… because clearly google and MSFT couldn’t. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 399.1 -> 412.6  
 Demand- 395.6 -> 406.6 -> 409.2  
 Support- 404.3 -> 401.4 -> 399.8  
 Resistance- 405.2 -> 406.8 -> 409.1

Futures confirmed the 4117 as resistance (not a new supply just back tested and held as resistance) and here we are seeing a push down to 4040/4055 supply to take those levels out. I remain bearish and until a new demand (support) is established our target should be this 4040/4055 supply. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Futures is set attempting to hold this 4081 support line after hours. However, now that we have a clear cut back test of the daily 20ema and closure under the 4095 critical support level… my downside target remains 4040/4055 which would be exactly touching the daily 100/200ema. There is potential of a bigger sell off down to 3920 but I would expect that to come post FOMC. 

Daily Futures Level  
 Supply- 4040 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4005 -> 4117  
 Support- 4081 -> 4055 -> 4040  
 Resistance-4095 -> 4110 -> 4138

**VIX**

&#x200B;

The VIX is a little hard to read here today… so on one hand we have a really clear and nice v bottom and we despite the doji candle did bounce to retest the daily 8ema support and closed over the daily 20ema for the 2nd time in a row… we have not done that since March 17th/ 20th. However, one could absolutely see this daily doji candle as a evening doji star reversal. 

The VIX clearly has been reacting to the FRC news and the markets are starting to finally accept some of bearishness that is ahead. GDP tomorrow morning will be incredibly interesting to see if markets start to price in a recession or not.

I absolutely struggled this morning. The volatility of opening hours was some of the highest (realized not relative) that I have seen in a while). Premiums were moving so fast it was nearly impossible to get filled and by time I did fill it seemed that we were immediately reversing. I have not had so many stop losses immediately hit in a very long time as I did today. 

Thankfully the 2nd half of the day I was really able to capitalize on price action and make it back and then some. Currently (even with my small lotto meta loss) im already over my weekly goal. With two days to go this week I look forward to putting in another profitable week. 

The hardest thing I struggle with lately is that at times I am noticing price action pushing through technical. There are a lot of times that I find myself missing the move as the technical never fully reset from say bearish to bullish to take a call… and there are other times it does reset and then it’s a fake out. 

However, the one thing I will say and I have said all of last year too is that capital preservation and risk management is the key to success… for instance at one point this morning was down about a full days profit goal… instead of revenge trading (despite getting frustrated at price action) I stuck to my rules, respected my stop losses and waited for my time to make some money. Its not always straight green and its not always easy trading every day. But no matter how good or bad of a day we are having/ have had we have to respect our strategy and our rules. 

Risk management will always be the key to long term success and profitability.",DaddyDersch,46,0.82,41,0,0,41,10,2023-04-26T20:39:24Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zyzqv/the_weekly_m_bearish_pattern_continues_to_play/

Activision released earnings early 
Net income - rose to 740 million from 395 million Activision’s net bookings were $1.86 billion, as compared with $1.48 billion for the first quarter of 2022. In-game net bookings were $1.29 billion, as compared with $1.01 billion for the first quarter of 2022.

Overall Activision Blizzard Monthly Active Users (MAUs)D were 368 million.

They absolutely decimated their earnings and still y’all have not gotten in on this. Even if the merger does not go through Activision will be more than fine on its own.

Addressing the Rumours: Some people seem to think that blizzard will break off from Activision and be sold separately to microsoft the UK AUTHORITIES HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT REMOVING TITLES LIKE COD IS NOT A FUCKING SOLUTION SO THIS AINT HAPPENING

Lastly the latest game in the diablo series is  set to launch soon and bring in nearly $700M. Literally a mfing monster title.

12zph3r,DD,Your lotto play for META's earnings tonight,"Yesterday, I posted about MSFT's earnings [and anyone who listed banked hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/). The stock is up 8.5% today, calls up massively. My last earning post before that was last week with [Tesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) which did extremely well too. Now we're looking to print more with META today. Who's ready? 

The company will report its Q1 2023 earnings today after market close. The Facebook parent has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of tech's year-to-date rally, the company's stock climbing nearly fucking *70%* in 2023 ($124 -> $211). The company's ""year of efficiency"" messaging and execution has resonated with shareholders (us), so the next question is – can ol' Zucky keep it up? 

Here's what analysts on Wall Street are expecting to see out of Meta:

* Revenue: $27.67 billion

* EPS: $2.01

* Advertising Revenue: $26.76 billion

* Family of Apps Revenue: $26.88 billion

* Reality Labs Operating Losses: $3.8 billion

I expect the stock to beat the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. The company outperformed the street estimates in the last quarter, despite a 4% y-o-y drop in the total revenues to $32.17 billion. The top line primarily suffered due to lower advertising revenues. Notably, the average revenue per user was down on a year-on-year basis. That said, the daily active users improved in the quarter. I expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.

Meta's ""Year of Efficiency"" has involved substantial cost-cutting at the company. In March, Meta announced it would lay off [10,000 workers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meta-to-cut-another-10000-jobs-zuckerberg-says/), building on the company's previous layoff announcement back in November, which affected [11,000 employees](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134139800/facebook-layoffs-instagram-meta). At the close of 2022, Meta had more than 80,000 employees. The impact of Meta’s cost-cutting initiatives such as reducing its headcount will be scrutinized.

A number of analysts are coming into this earnings cycle with substantial optimism about Meta's trajectory (including me). JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth currently has Meta at Overweight and raised his price target on March 24 for the company to $270 from $225, reiterating the company as a ""top pick.""

""Importantly, 2023 may be the 'Year of Efficiency,' but we believe Meta is building the critical muscle for financial discipline over the long term,"" he wrote in the March note. ""Meta shares have more than doubled off their early November lows but we still think there’s meaningful upside ahead driven by accelerating revenue growth, continued cost efficiencies, and still attractive valuation.""

However, challenges remain for Meta, as investors will look for improvement in the much-talked-about losses generated by the company's metaverse operation, Reality Labs, which lost a [whopping $13.7 billion in 2022](https://news.yahoo.com/meta-reality-labs-lost-13-230453969.html). Reality Labs is expected to report a loss of [$3.8 billion](https://www.forex.com/en-ca/market-analysis/latest-research/what-will-big-tech-earnings-mean-for-the-nasdaq-100-outlook/) in the first quarter, up from a loss of $2.96 billion for the same period last year. However, this would be an improvement quarter-over-quarter, with Meta posting a $4.28 billion loss from Reality Labs in 4Q 2022.

Additionally, company watchers are hoping Meta can begin to leave the digital ad slowdown of the last year in its past. Early data indicates that, on the ad market front at least, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. The decrease was due to a slight drop in advertising revenues, which suffered because of tough macroeconomic conditions. The same was evident from the ARPU figure for the year – down 3% y-o-y. On the flip side, the DAUs increased by 4% y-o-y. I believe the Q1 results will follow the same trend.

""We think investors are cautiously optimistic on an improving digital ad market, while META has improved its cost structure and have given investors more confidence in management's commitment to profitability,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black on April 24. ""Recent ad checks indicated March ad spend was higher than anticipated and engagement data with Facebook and Instagram has been positive relative to peers.""

So despite the Reality lab losses, I think META will beat estimates and will shoot up AH. So the play will be similar to MSFT, a call spread. I'll be getting META 4/28 215c and selling the 230c. This will cost $470, but can offer 3.2x gains if this goes our way.",CalmGains,107,0.9,131,0,0,131,0,2023-04-26T16:37:31Z,False,False,t2_8vyhj5k4g,15,304,10,106,2023-04-09T17:30:16Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/

12zh7y1,DD,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #036: 6 Insiders at Intuitive Surgical Sell Combined ~$35M, Regional Banks Catch a Bid - Insider Trading Recap","GM WSB - 

TL;DR - Overall transaction activity is up slightly (+7%), while purchases ($9.4M / -3%) and sales ($484M / -66%)  are both down from the prior week. This is the second week in a row where we have not seen sizable bids in the data. Several weeks back, Buffett, Icahn, and several other 10% block owners were repeatedly at the top of the charts, raising total purchasing activity.

I found two other details of particular interest in this week’s review:

1. Insiders at regional banks represent the majority of purchasing activity. This seems odd, given the apparent calamity that First Republic Bank is in at the moment. Though perhaps they are banking (pun intended) for light at the end of the tunnel vis-a-vis a Fed bailout, should withdrawals persist.
2. $34.7M was sold by six insiders at Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG / Medical Instruments & Supplies). We saw a similar pattern with Apple executives last week where $40M+ was sold. Once again, pretty sizable company (ISRG is a Large-Cap), and could very well be a non-blackout period for them to trade. But as you will see the percent change in shares is all quite high, so no way that it was going to be looked over for this week’s update.

# Notable sales from insiders:

* Blackstone Energy Management Associates, a 10% owner of Viper Energy ($VNOM / Oil & Gas Midstream), sold 20.54% of their stake in a $54.3M sale on April 18th
* Richard Rothberg, General Counsel & Secretary of Dell Technologies ($DELL / Computer Hardware), sold 57.36% of his stake in a $9.1M sale on April 18th
* Andrew Craig Miller, the COO of Karuna Therapeutics ($KRTX / Biotechnology), sold 73.89% of his stake in a $9M sale on April 18th
* Goran Skoko, an EVP of Research & Advisory at Factset ($FDS / Financial Data & Stock Exchanges), sold 64.68% of his shares in a $3.29M sale on April 17th
* Six insiders at Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG / Medical Instruments & Supplies) sold shares on April 21st:
   * **David Rosa** (EVP & Chief Strategy and Growth Officer) sold $24.3M (41.51% of stake)
   * **Myriam Curet** (EVP & Chief Medical Officer), sold $2.8M (100% of stake)
   * **Robert Desantis** (EVP & Chief Product Officer), sold $2.56M (74.26% of stake)
   * **Mark Rubash** (Director), sold $2.9M (-52.7% of stake)
   * **Craig Barratt** (Director), sold $1.78M (-100% of stake)
   * **Fredrik Widman** (VP, Corporate Controller), sold $187K (-22%)

# Notable buys from insiders:

* **Alan Colberg**, a Director at Us Bancorp ($USB / Banks - Regional), increased his stake by 20,000% in a $341K purchase on April 21st
* **John Donovan**, a Director at Lockheed Martin ($LMT / Aerospace & Defense) increased his stake by 21.77% in a $250K purchase on April 19th

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases decreased from $9.7M to $9.4M (-3%)
* Sales decreased from $1.4B to $484M (-66%)
* Transactions increased from 323 to 345 (+7%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 180 to 198 (+5%)
   * Net buyers increased from 17 to 21 (+24%)
   * Net sellers increased from 172 to 177 (+3%) 
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 275 to 307 (+12%)
   * Net buyers increased from 23 to 44 (+91%)
   * Net sellers increased from 252 to 263 (+4%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **April 17th - April 21st.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 10th - April 14th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind Form Fore

12zfj8y,DD,Volume tickers in play.,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",Badboyardie,2,0.67,2,0,0,2,0,2023-04-26T12:09:12Z,Edited,False,t2_24hau26v,667,2051,162,473,2019-02-15T23:52:47Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zfj8y/volume_tickers_in_play/
12zc19x,DD,Prediction: FRC will survive and recover,"Disclaimer: I am long 1400 shares on FRC at $12.00. I stayed up all night going over their Q1 financials running various scenarios. I work in finance and prepare / review financial statements for a living, so I'm highly regarded as an expert when it comes to this stuff (however **this post is not financial advice**). 

After poring over [their financials](https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a), I'm growing increasingly confident that First Republic Bank will survive the most recent round of panic selling that we witnessed yesterday. I am predicting that the bank will not be seized by the FDIC and will return to profitability by 2024 after some restructuring. I am basing this opinion on several facts that I have outlined below. I may also be just huffing massive amounts of copium so take this FWIW.  


1. **FRC does not currently have a liquidity problem.** They have $45b cash & credit available vs. customer deposits of $104b (cash to deposit ratio of 0.43). The same ratio in Q4 2022, prior to the panic, was 0.53 ($94b cash and credit vs. deposits of $176b). This is the key reason I think they will survive. As long as they are liquid and able to pay depositors, there is no reason for the FDIC to step in.  

2. **FRC has and will continue to have positive net margin interest.** Net margin interest is the difference between interest income and interest expense. This is what had the market really worried with FRC. Since the bank is now borrowing money at higher rates from the federal reserve discount window to replace deposit outflows, the market assumption is that FRC's increased interest expense will make it death spiral. In their earnings disclosure, FRC provided the interest rates on their various assets and liabilities. Extrapolating those rates to future quarters shows that they will remain positive on net margin interest, ie their interest income will exceed their interest expense, even with the more expensive borrowings on their books. IF they do absolutely nothing, they will lose $91m in the next quarter (their first loss in many years). That's a very modest loss and hardly enough to take out a bank of their size.  

3. **FRC has a viable path to profitability.** As they already outlined in the earnings call, FRC plans to sell between $50b to $100b of its loan portfolio. They will use this to pay down the amounts they have borrowed from the discount window. They will have to sell at a discount considering their bargaining position and the high-interest rate environment, but they can leverage the fact that their customers are high net worth with the potential to bring in more business to whoever buys the loan (wealth management being top of mind). If they execute this, perhaps with the help of the same banks that assisted them with the $30b deposit earlier, they will significantly improve their net margin interest. From the details filtering out in the press, the sale of the assets is a necessary first step to allow them to be able to raise capital from private equity to shore up their balance sheet.   

4. **The FDIC does not want to step in.** The earnings release is not a surprise to the FDIC, they get up to date reports from FRC daily. If the situation was bad enough to put them in receivership, they would have done that weeks ago (remember, the Q1 earnings release shows us numbers from March 31). The FDIC coffers already got drained due to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures, they will not seize FRC unless its absolutely necessary to protect depositors (which it isn't because FRC is liquid). The other banks also do not want FRC to fail, because they will be on the hook to reimburse the FDIC via a special assessment for losses arising out of FRC's failure.  

5. **FRC's deposit base is more loyal than SVB.** SVB's clients were mostly start-ups, who by their nature live in a world of disruption with a here-today-gone-tomorrow view of the world. Contrast that with FRC's clients, who are mostly high-net worth individuals. The remaining depositors at FRC already weathered the first round of panic, so we can assume the more skittish depositors have already left. Also, FRC is known for its excellent customer service and personalized wealth management practice.   


I ran several scenarios based on the plan outlined by FRC executives. I believe if they succeed in carrying out the restructuring they outlined, that they will return to profitability by 2024, with an earnings per share of about 1.86. Typically, bank stocks trade 12x earnings, which would mean a fair market value of $22.32. Not exactly a moonshot but may be a value pick during recessionary times.

Anyway it's early morning now and looks like FRC is up to $8.45 pre-market, I am going to hodl and ride it out into the sunset. If you are like me and obsessed with this dumb bank, I hope your experience with it will be profitable.",VPLumbergh,258,0.59,46,0,0,46,0,2023-04-26T09:26:14Z,False,False,t2_9m0kn,97,2261,2,12,2012-11-15T10:52:29Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zc19x/prediction_frc_will_survive_and_recover/

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Yummier 🌈🦄

Yo puddin', technically speaking, squiggly lines and fancy-schmancy indicators love to use yesterday's prices to guess where we'll be partyin' today. 🎉📈

Using some big words, like ""option open interest"", we get all cool with Greeks—Delta and Gamma, not the dudes in togas. 😜 We can then play around with what these numbers do at different price points to see some surprising twists and turns. 💃🕺

For some ticker fiends, prices react all huffy-puffy to delta neutrality, gamma max-outs, or both! It's basically a Harley Quinn-level rollercoaster ride, hun! 🎢🃏

These past reactions are what we use to come up with super-duper predictions. Trading signals are like clues to the ultimate prize, hun! 🏆💰

Our plays and target entry prices are calculated with fancy math stuff, like binomials, to give us juicy reactions from gamma max and delta neutral. Yum! 😋 We want our best plays to benefit from moves in price *and* increases in fancy volatility stuff. 🎯📊

## Notes - Wrinkle that noggin' 🤔💭

* Missed our target entry price? Be cautious, puddin'! Something changed between planning the party and arriving at the bash. 🥳🚨
* Scored a double? Sell half and play with the rest as you please! 🎲✌️
* Wanna bet big? Risk up to 1% of your treasure chest. Not feelin' it? Go for 0.25% to 0.5% and spread out your cash. 💵💰
* Keep in mind, these trades were calculated before the market opened, and are based on yesterday's gossip. Keep an eye out for new shenanigans today.🕵️‍♀️📰

## FAQ - In case you ain't payin' attention 💡❓

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a baddie bear? 🐻💔
   * Nah, cupcake. It just so happens companies had a wild run, and now they might need a lil' break. Our trades are like mean-reversion hugs! 🤗
* You takin' all these plays? 🎲💸
   * Nope, but I thought I'd share my chaotic bag o' tricks with my fellow apes to help y'all score some sweet gainz. 🦍💥
* New play on an old fave? Whatcha talkin' 'bout? 🔄🗣️
   * Simple, the new play kicks out the old one. The oldie's probably no good, so don't go chasin' after lost balloons. 🎈
* Where's the crayon art? 🖍️🎨
   * Follow the shiny links above, sweetums. 🌟🔗
* Did you back-test this? 🤖📚
   * Sure did! Got a respectable Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a party-hard win rate of 63% (7% margin of error). 🎊📈
* How'd it go back in time? 🔙🕰️
   * History gave us a Sharpe Ratio of 1.85 and a win rate of 68%. That means we're pretty darn sure we'll keep winning 63-75% of the time.

12yvp9l,DD,"The next leg down has begun… 4-25-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Daily Market Analysis (MSFT and Goog Earnings bonus)","Well last week my price target was 409.19 SPY and 4116 ES and we have officially hit those levels!

Now that we have seen one day of this… I will be very curious to see how the VIX1D does EOD with correlation to the next day. 

My next major target and potential source of a bounce on SPY is 405.2/ 4055 Futures. 

**MSFT**

Really nice beat there on MSFT EPS and revenue wise pretty much a sweep across the board. 

https://preview.redd.it/jw7iw44sf3wa1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9477c89b2145ba9a311b683fe8bffeb7e16c833

I did not play MSFT earnings as I just honestly generally do not play earnings… though I am considering a META and AMZN lotto play… but overall looks like MSFT is going to have a nice upside move. 292 will be a major upside weekly target and resistance for MSFT. 

**GOOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/83hw93atf3wa1.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4c04264624e66459764d24f068a5a68d78454b2

Goog actually came in with a beat on EPS too and some pretty decent revenue beats… they also authorized an impressive 70 billion buyback too. 

I actually would have expected a miss on google and this is its first beat on EPS since Q1 2022. 

Puts clearly were not the play on Goog. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Taking a look at daily supply and demand here I mentioned how with the way supply and demand has been moving lately I would not be surprised to see us immediately turn around today and turn demandt back into supply… that is exactly what we did… 412 demand now becomes 412.62 supply. 

We also came all the way down and took our 409.73 supply finally. We did fall just short of 405.17 supply though. 

If we continue this sell off tomorrow our target is 405.17 followed by a bigger eow and into next week sell off to 399.07 supply. If we can take out 399.07 supply then I would be more confident in a longer term and stronger bounce to the upside. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfsvgz4uf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a8b3eed4d3ac49dce5a5d073c7e9023684eeab8

SPY officailly has broken out of the 15 day long range of 406.6 to 415.6 with todays close. Not only that we closed our first -1%+ day since March 22nd. 

We also clsoed under the daily 20ema for the first time since March 23rd. One thing on SPY is it likes to back test the EMAs. Now I did think we could immediately turn around and reject that daily 8ema recovery from yesterday the bloody premarket made tahtjust a straight drop. We came dangerously close to hitting 405.2 today but we were not quite able to get there… I will be watching that level extremely close going forward. 

If we can break through and CLOSE under 405.2 I feel fairly confident in a sell off down to that 399-400 area. However, IF the bulls can hard bounce us off 405.2 and potentailly turn 405.13 supply into demand then I actually would favor a push back up to 412-416 leading into FOMC.

I wouldn’t be totally surprised to see an upside push tomorrow to retest the daily 20ema resistance. As long as we close under that I would remain bearish going forward. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 405.1 -> 399  
 Demand- 406.7 -> 409.2  
 Support- 405.2 -> 404.2  
 Resistance- 408.1 -> 409.1 -> 410.6

 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cn0y4zmuf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52b602bd5e45b4d4c6330e3ec9f90d5de581d7ce

Just like SPY futures immediately turned around and turned 4153 demand into supply (resistance) at 4157.

We did not take out any previous demands or supplies today but we did close below that key 4116 demand. We now have a fairly large gap in supply/ demand with downside target at 4040/4055. We also have a supply all the way down at 4015 that too needs to be taken out. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9q4jh4vf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab4c075fc3df71bb82c2e8fa65c0bdcc1a8cd788

When I said that futures could immediately turn around and make 4160 a double top looking at the TOS chart that is exactly what I was talking about. Actually this is where my love hate relationship with TV forms as I love TV for ease of charting but its price action is “oof” sometimes… as you can see on TOS futures closed a confirmed 4157 double top but if you look below its not an actual double top on trading view. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjuww7lvf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62d5ee3b6578d777af043683f9f27a517e17acd5

Now the biggest thing here to note is that we too did break out and close below the 4113 to 4178 channel that we have been consolidating in for 15 days… With a break down like this on futures and spy we should 100% expect a bigger move to be had. Now prior to MSFT and GOOG earnings being released we actually were setting up for a closure under 4095 which is a majorly bearish movement. 

I will look for a possible retest of the daily 20ema at 4125 tomorrow and then look for a continuation back and closure back under 4095. If bears can get this closed under 4095 I do for see that bigger push down to the daily 100/200ema at 4040/4055. However, IF bulls can bounce us off good earnings then there is a chance that we will see a push back to 4138 resistance before attempting to retest 4160-4198 area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4160 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4116 -> 4005  
 Support- 4095 -> 4080  
 Resistance- 4118 -> 4138 -> 4160

**VIX**

The VIX had an impressive day today being up about 18% at one point. Now we always have to look at the WHY… why was the VIX pumping today and SPY dumping? Well FRC said it might sell up to 100 billion in assets… why does this matter? Well this shows that this banking crisis is far from over… Markets needed a reason to sell and we might have gotten that reason finally…

Now we did see a pretty sizeable drop on the VIX by EOD but if we continue to see more banking issues we very well might see continuation to the downside despite what the big tech earnings do this week. 

&#x200B;

Whats actually interesting to me today is that probability of a 25bps rate hike next week dropped from about 88% to 77% today… people are now beginning again to think that JPOW is going to pause because of the banking crisis. 📷

Even more wild is that we are beginning to price in a CUT in June already (this of course assumes we get a 25 bps hike next week).

I had a field trip with my daughter today so I wasn’t able to trade but I was able to close my long term 405 puts pretty much at the LOD. I wouldn’t have minded holding these but being OTM and I was heavy in these I wanted to close and reposition. 

I am now in July 21st (87dte) 408 puts… my ultimate target for these is 399-400. IF we happen to get a rogue rip back to 415 I will happily average down there again. 

Looking forward to trading the rest of the week.

12ytt9u,DD,Why I'm getting MSFT calls for earnings.,"Microsoft (MSFT) will report its third fiscal quarter (Q3) 2023 results today after the market closes. The report will cover the quarter from January 2023 to March 2023.

**Microsoft Earnings Expectation**

Revenues: $51.05 billion. 4% year-over-year growth but 4% lower than the previous quarter.

EPS: $2.23, no change from a year ago and 3.8% lower than Q2.

**What to watch for**

Out of the three business divisions, the Intelligent Cloud department has become Microsoft’s gold mine nowadays, contributing 40% of the group’s total revenue with sound and solid growth momentum. In the previous quarter, the cloud services’ revenue increased 18% while whole group’s revenue only added 2%.

For the to-be-reported quarterly earnings, Microsoft anticipated revenues from the Intelligent Cloud will keep increasing at the pace between 17% and 19% to a range of $21.7-$22 billion. However, Microsoft also flagged that Azure, the cloud computing platform that which is one of the main engines of the cloud business, would slow down its growing speed by 4 or 5 percentage points to near 30% in the fiscal third quarter, down from 46% in the same period last year.

Q2 FY23 Financial Summary: https://i.imgur.com/zNmvSEH.png

**The laggard**

The downtrend in the global personal computing industry has accelerated in the past year. So did Microsoft’s PC business. In the six months ended December 31th, the revenue from the PC related business was down 11% YOY, while in the last three month, the yearly downfall rate was speed up to 19%.

The first quarter of this year has marked the fifth consecutive quarter of global PC sales decline. As such, it's not difficult to see that this hard-to-stop slide will further falter the demand for all the product line under the umbrella of Personal Computing. The used-to-be-proud King of the PC projected this sector's revenue for Q3 will be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, indicating a 14%-17% decline from the same quarter last year.

https://i.imgur.com/oz4yDzf.png

**The AI Race**

The battlefield for the AI race has been set up and the smoke is getting intense.

Microsoft seemly led the way for now thanks to its shared commitment with OpenAI to build generative AI systems--ChatGPT has convinced the world in 2023 that, AI will become a topping layer of technology and prompt a new generation of “platform shift”.

Clearly, all the tech giants are not hesitated to go all-in in the AI race and are ready to thrive in this new age. Microsoft, despite racing inches ahead now, is facing the fiercest competition in decades. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, unveiled a similar AI function in March for Gmail, which is now used by 1.8 billion people around the world. Apple disclosed that 45% of its M&A targets are AI-related compared to Microsoft’s 23% now. In terms of the bright minds, Meta has employed 23.5% of staff with AI skills while Microsoft’s ratio is 21.8%

Additionally, the ticket to the AI race is very costly. Microsoft has boosted its R&D investment in the previous quarter by 18% to 6.8 billion, which, saw its net margin fell from 36% to 30% in the September quarter.

As Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella said in January: “The next major wave of computing is being born.” Microsoft is not shy with its ambition to be the king of the new wave, the challenge being, all its old foes are thinking the same.

**Microsoft Share Price**

Despite the bright limelight this year thanks to ChatGPT, Microsoft’s stock price didn’t enjoy extra shine compared to other tech titans. But the good news is the price has clearly bottomed out from the Nov-Jan low when the two-year-low was made.

Based on the weekly chat, the stock is currently attempting to challenge the August peak at around 291-296, a hurdle that could open the door to $300 psychological level if successfully conquered.

Conversely, if the break fails, any pullback should be supported by the 100-MA to preserve the bull-biased momentum. However, a fall below this level will risk further breaching the current ascending trajectory and increase the chance of a bear-reversal.

But the recent price movements are not going to play a role in whether it goes up or down tonight. I believe it would be smart to get calls for earnings. I think a MSFT call spread would be good. Buy the 4/28 280c and sell the 290c, which would cost about $277. You could be leaving with 3.6x gains if this goes well!",CalmGains,27,0.84,46,0,0,46,0,2023-04-25T19:46:47Z,False,False,t2_8vyhj5k4g,15,304,10,106,2023-04-09T17:30:16Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/
12ytiiq,DD,"The upcoming slowdown in chips -- not potato chips, but semiconductor chips you regard","# Preface

Listen up regards, on April 7th, Samsung posted its Q1 2023 guidance. In-case you were hiding under your mom's bed from her drunk bf that day, the results were worse than abysmal. Here is the headline you need to know according to the WSJ: *Samsung Forecasts Worst Profit in Over a Decade as Tech Slump Hits Memory Chips*.

* From $59 Billion rev. to $48 Billion year-over-year (YoY). A whopping -19% year-over-year drop.
* From $10.7 Billion operating profit to $455 Million YoY. -95.6%. That's a lot and it's the worst profit results since 2009 (percentage wise still less than what some of you regards lose on 0dte).

Did I also mention Samsung commands a 15.8% global marketshare of semis ([http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=110893](http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=110893))

As a result, Samsung declared ""meaningful"" cuts into production. ANALysts interpreted this as a win for Micron, which saw a ridiculous rally of 8% on April 10th, which has since melted away its gains as of April 25th. I hope you bought puts. I did.

What else happened leading up to April 10th? IDC released its Q1 2023 report ([https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723)) which saw PC manufacturers shipping less computers YoY by an average of -29%. Apple was the star of this report, shipping -40.5% less computers.

It just keeps getting worse on April 10th, as TSMC reported its first drop in monthly revenue in almost four years. ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tsmc-posts-first-revenue-drop-in-nearly-four-years-a020fe58](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tsmc-posts-first-revenue-drop-in-nearly-four-years-a020fe58)) Yeah you read that right, the same TSMC that Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway had recently liquidated 86% out of. ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/buffett-says-geopolitics-factor-berkshire-sale-tsmc-stake-2023-04-11/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/buffett-says-geopolitics-factor-berkshire-sale-tsmc-stake-2023-04-11/))

Fast forward to April 20h, where we have TSMC's earnings. While the bottom line EPS was a beat ($1.31 vs $1.21), its top line rev was $16.7 Billion, missing estimates of $17.3 Billion. TSMC's Q2 guidance came in between $15.2 and $16 Billion.

With all this shit guidance, you can't ignore what lay ahead. After all, semis requires a metric ton of capital. Foundries ain't cheap to build and operate, and you know what else ain't cheap? Interest rates, and we've yet begun to price it in. See where I'm going here?

# What's the deal?

Looking at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index $SOX, it's clear it's running out of steam. Having formed a bearish divergence against the RSI, I'm expecting the worst. Don't believe me? Look at the charts for other semis - AMD, NVDA, INTC (lolz), QCOM, etc.

12ydzy8,DD,Net interest income and net interest margins. This is all you need to know about FRC and where it's headed.,"No idea how so many people here fail to see and understand this. The crisis happen in mid-March. Their results were 10 weeks of ""normal"" followed by 2-3 weeks of stress. Those 2-3 weeks of stress had the following impact on their NII and NIM:  

1. Net interest income was $923 million for the quarter, down 21.4% compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to substantially higher funding costs.  

2. The net interest margin decreased to 1.77% for the quarter, from 2.45% in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher short-term borrowings, which was partially offset by the impact of CD withdrawal penalties that increased the net interest margin by 11 basis points.  

So if you extrapolate those couple weeks of stress to an entire quarter (which is what you'll see in Q2 and each quarter going forward), you'll realize that their funding costs have absolutely exploded and they are fucked going forward. 2 weeks of stress took out 21% of their net income and dropped their NIM 70 bps. Imagine what the next 13 will be like.    

They are borrowing like $100B from the Fed and got charity deposits for $30B from other banks. So $130B of their funds now have rates of 4-5%.  

They were paying on average 77 bps to depositors as of December 2022. Now they are paying more than 50% of their ""depositors"" 4-5%. Q2 is going to be an enormous loss, and so will every quarter after that. They have no way of getting cheap deposits back and their loans that can be sold are heavily under water (which is what the problem was in the first place).  

They're a zombie. They can't pay back the Fed loans since they need them, but they can't afford the interest on them either. The likely outcome is terrible for common shareholders no matter what. Best-case is a capital raise that completely destroys common shareholders. Worst-case the Fed just breaks them up over the next month by facilitating asset sales to other parties, forcing losses on FRC until there's ultimately nothing left (probably backstopping losses for acquirers or just taking the losses itself in what is essentially another bailout.)  

No way common shareholders are walking away with anything.",throwaway1177171728,95,0.9,133,0,0,133,0,2023-04-25T09:25:00Z,Edited,False,t2_hqa0gaow,29,1634,6,298,2021-12-19T19:15:40Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ydzy8/net_interest_income_and_net_interest_margins_this/

Picture this, sugar: technical analysis is like predicting where lightning ⚡ will strike based on past storms. Sure, it's flirty, but don't get yourself burnt 🔥.

Our current options open interest is spicing things up by calculating sizzling portfolio-level greeks like Delta and Gamma 📈. From there, we're having some fun simulating changes in greeks at different price points 🎉. We want to find those sweet spots where portfolio-level gamma is soaring and delta is playing shy (close to 0) 😉

For some tickers, the underlying price gets super passionate around delta neutral, gamma max, or both 💗. It's the steamy past reactions off these price levels giving us the best trading signals today 🥰.

We're serving up plays and target entry prices calculated with a binomial option pricing model, making every moment feel like a sultry candlelit dinner 🍷. Lots of these plays are profitable on the dance floor, but the best ones get extra flirty with directional moves and increased IV 💃.

12xxsy7,DD,"4-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX1D and VIX Daily Markets Analysis","NOTE- I will be gone from trading tomorrow on my kids field trip… should still have a nightly TA up though. 

Lets start off with VIX1D and with today and its first days launch… 

Someone in the group posted this and I found it to be hilarious… The fact that a VIX1D with a pretty clear in my opinion measurement and it “baffled” them just makes me laugh. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mcnlu1mzkwva1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cee7ae11369b0a7cac6a68f9e3d6c7f492bf5aff

Honestly I found the VIX1D to be extremely helpful paired with my already current scalping and level to level strategy. I am actually really looking forward to using the VIX1D more as we go forward. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ldens070lwva1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b36a5196c4802721f0125da4a36849a2544e2a6

I mentioned last week that I felt that SPY supply and demand was showing an imbalance and well today we actually partially fixed that imbalance. We actually did an extreme bullish thing and turned daily supply at 412 into daily demand (support). With that and a recovery back over the daily 8ema our upside target now moves to 414.22. 

However, the trend lately seems to be putting in quick supply and demands back to back… Looking at physical price action (especially futures) its very indecisive. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cq07f2r0lwva1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51a98840b1383578f65ff9fa11b6e5228a74f63f

It is hard to tell in this image but the red lines actually form another rising wedge inside of the black longer time frame rising wedge. 

Something that is very interesting when we look at price action over the last 15 trading days is that on SPY 6 of those have been doji candles, the last 15 trading days has all closed within a $9 range and the last 8 trading days has closed within a $4.3 range with half of those candles closing as dojis…

While we did retake the daily 8ema here I think I would be neutral to bullish here and even if there is upside to be expected tomorrow based on the last 3 weeks of trading the upside is very limited. 

This $9 range has a support at 406.5 and resistance at 415.5 inside of that range is just chop.. Also have a 8 day long support at 411.1 to keep an eye on too. 

Honestly the last 3 weeks of SPY feels like the 1130am to 230pm trading slot during the day where SPY keeps showing its going to breakout or breakdown but in the end it just ends up being yet again another fake out. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 415.4 -> 417  
 Demand- 412 -> 414.2  
 Support- 411.9 -> 409.6  
 Resistance- 412.6 -> 414.1 -> 415.5.

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nsej0291lwva1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1563a099984710213653451271352fedf67ee63

Futures with that yet again EOD run up managed to put in a new demand… this seems to be a strong theme here on SPY and futures where the last minute of trading defines the day… 

But with a new demand (support) put in at 4153 our upside target should be a retest of supply (resistance) at 4178. 

I love my supply and demand but I also recognize that not every market is perfect for it… with this choppy indecisiveness going on S/D is not playing out nearly as nicely as before… however, I will say looking at Futures right now we have defined the 15 day range period perfectly… 

We have a supply (resistance) at 4198 and 4178 and we have demand (support) at 4116 and 4153. We have a pretty clear cut defined area here. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o7k361q1lwva1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a2a7838576fb4beaa5e6db2e30a7843be45f6fa

Now on futures we have actually closed 12 of the last 15 trading days as some form of a doji all within a 67 point range… and over the last 8 trading days we have closed 6 dojis within a 31 point range. This is extremely tight and I would imagine whenever we finally pick a direction and move it will be pretty explosive… 

I do wonder now with FOMC next Wednesday already if we just continue to chop in this same pattern. We also have big tech earnings over the next three days which also could define the market. 

Futures did retake the daily 8ema today but we have often times seen a pattern like this turn immediately back into a failed breakout/ double top… there is a potential to turn 4160 into a double top and attempt to push back to 4130-4140 tomorrow. However, if bulls can keep up the momentum then our upside target would be 4178. 

**VIX1D/ VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7q35jod2lwva1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8d8d20ef20a2d93767ac36d8c0f32cdcea759b3d

One thing that intrigues me for tomorrow about VIX1D is that EOD we had a massive pump to HOD on the VIX1D… however, we also had a huge EOD 5min candle. My thoughts are now that we have this VIX1D tool is can we predict the next days movement or not… so with EOD pump will we see overnight downside or will we be left once again with upside? 

I do play to do some daily charting on VIX1D much like on VIX but we need at least a few weeks of candles before we can start making any sort of educated analysis… 

Also for those of you having trouble finding the VIX… on TOS its live data and free… but you have to type it into the ticker symbol search “VIX1D” and hit enter… it will not populate on search… on TV I noticed the data is about 20 minutes behind… I do pay for live data on TV but they grouped the VIX1D under the “CBOE Global Indices Feed” which is not apart of the standard live data most will have. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j3hqt0z2lwva1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=17fdb1ff479e59fd452500f4fb86e14eca0afdbf

The VIX one again saw a massive drop. One thing that was interesting to me and a big of a change of pace from the normal is that the VIX opened nearly 4%+ and had began to sell off only to see a midday reversal back up. For a while it did appear that we were going to see the VIX clos over the daily 8ema, however, by EOD once again the VIX sold off as SPY rose. 

We still are holding the bear channel and the potential V bottom/ breakout triangle support will sit at 16.76 tomorrow and resistance will be at 18.24.

Today was a really solid day of trading. I struggled a little bit at open getting caught in both puts and calls stop losses. But was able to make it up on the morning sell off… I told myself after the last 2 weeks of getting absolutely ate up during the middle of the day that I was not going to let that happen today. I did give back a little bit of profits but nothing too bad.

All in all covered about 60% of my weekly goal profit wise today which is super nice considering I wont be trading tomorrow.

12xqws2,DD,NextDecade (NEXT): a Texas LNG producer that is projected to FID in June (13$ price targe),"Here is some dd I've done and compiled on the prospective liquified natural gas exporter based in Texas, NextDecade LNG:

* NextDecade is developing the 27 mmbtu, 5 train Rio Grande LNG export project.
* RGLNG claims to be the world's first and only LNG export terminal with integrated carbon capture and storage.
* Biden administration’s FERC lifts remand on Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG, allowing both projects to move forward after nearly 20 months of delays
* The company has signed eight long-term sale and purchase agreements totaling 11 mmbtu of offtake. A 4 mmbtu SPA deal is reportedly in the final stages with TotalEnergies (source: POTEN & Partners)
* NextDecade is holding discussions with MUFG bank and Macquarie Capital to secure financing

### Introduction

NextDecade Corporation is a natural gas company that engages in the liquefaction and sale of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and capture and storage of CO2 emissions. It focuses on the development activities on the Rio Grande LNG terminal facility located in the Port of Brownsville in southern Texas; and a carbon capture and storage project (CCS project) at the terminal, as well as on other CCS projects with third-party industrial source facilities. 

So in essence, NextDecade has an interesting LNG project that has good geography and scale. It also comes with plans for an integrated carbon capture and storage solution, differentiating NextDecade's LNG cargoes from that of other export terminals

Analysts say FERC's approval could give NextDecade (NEXT) the momentum it needs to reach a final investment decision for Rio Grande LNG, which has reached sales and purchase agreements for 10.75M metric tons of its anticipated 27 tons/year of liquefied natural gas. 

NextDecade Corp. said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it has amended its agreements with Bechtel Energy Inc. to lock in the prices of its engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts until June 15 for the proposed Rio Grande LNG export terminal in South Texas.

### What is Rio Grande LNG?

The RGLNG project is a fully permitted LNG export terminal, envisioned to ultimately have the capacity to export 27 mtpa of LNG through 5 liquefaction trains. The project is located at the Port of Brownsville, Texas, with deepwater port access and supporting marine infrastructure. It is designed to use proven liquefaction technology from Air Products and Chemicals (APD) and Baker Hughes (BKR). RGLNG will be supplied with natural gas from the Permian and Eagle Ford shale basins via the Rio Bravo Pipeline, a 4.5 Bcf/d pipeline to be built by Enbridge Inc. (ENB).

&#x200B;

[FERC presentation November 2021](https://preview.redd.it/1dd26g5xevva1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb231910d551dc7a1716e9ceb9d0a02ec0d7e4b6)

As mentioned above, RGLNG will connect LNG customers with the resource-rich Permian and Eagle Ford basins, which have a combined 700 Tcf of natural gas resource. At the same time, NextDecade believes RGLNG's location in South Texas is a competitive differentiator as it avoids potential gas supply and concentration risk with other Upper Texas/Louisiana LNG operators. Furthermore, Brownsville is less susceptible to large-scale hurricanes, as the area has only experienced 1 hurricane of Cat 3 and above since 1990 versus 10 storms of Cat 3 and above in Louisiana.

### Projected costs and valuation

Under the current agreement, the company’s EPC costs with Bechtel are estimated at $11.5 billion. The prices would cover three liquefaction trains, two 180,000 cubic meter storage tanks and two marine berths. The first phase would have the capacity to produce 17.6 million metric tons/year (mmt/year) of LNG. The facility as designed would ultimately include five trains and have a capacity of 27 mmt/y.

Bechtel has already started with some early site work after NextDecade issued a limited notice to proceed in October

While it’s difficult to value a pre-construction LNG export facility, NEXT currently trades around 5$ to 6$ per share. According to Evercore, their DCF model including weighted outcomes of bull/base/bear case scenarios represented by full-development, phase one development, and liquidation (see table below) and achieve a weighted target price of 13.5$ at FID 

[Evercore SI valuation of NextDecade LNG](https://preview.redd.it/rh29qvl4fvva1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d36702a89c497fe32cbe56bd51cd16af8420ab4)

According to Evercore ISI, if NEXT announces FID on Phase 1, on 17 mtpa, its production would be worth $20 billion on a pro-rata basis when compared to a $65 billion valuation for Cheniere which has a 55 mtpa production. If they assume an 80% construction#financing risk discount to Cheniere, evercore arrives at a conservative $4 billion risk adjusted market cap estimate post FID, whis is equivalent to 4.3x the current market price of 6.2$/share (i.e. 28$/s at current float) 

### Competition and risks/ESG Concerns

NEXT is of course subject to many macroeconomic and global risks, the biggest one being if the firm fails to have sufficient contracts to reach FID. However with FERC removing the remand and approving all permits, a rumoured deal with TotalEnergies will clinch all contracts needed to secure financing and FID by summer 2023. NextDecade is developing a capital intensive and highly complex LNG facility along with the infrastructure. therefore construction related problems and delays could occur down the road. Having said that, Bechtel is one of the best builders in the business and will mitigate those risks. 

There are plenty of SPA deals signed, but most projects still need more. Next is pretty close to securing all it needs to issue a Final Investment Decision this summer.

NextDecade said in the regulatory filing that the Bechtel amendment would “extend the price validity,” but cautioned that it may change if an NTP is not issued by June 15.

The company has signed eight long-term sale and purchase agreements totaling 11 mmty of offtake. Seven deals were signed or expanded last year amid a record year for U.S. LNG contracting as overseas buyers looked to shield themselves from volatility on the spot market.

NextDecade is committed to environmental stewardship, which includes reducing emissions and mitigating impacts to wetland and wildlife. For example, at our Rio Grande LNG project, itwill meet or exceed all environmental and other regulatory requirements, which include strict standards governing impacts on air, land, water, and wildlife. for more details on Next Carbon Capture Solutions and ESG please read [here](https://www.next-decade.com/next-carbon-solutions/)

### Conclusion

NextDecade is expected to announce shortly that it has signed its final and largest SPA of around 4 MMt/y with TotalEnergies. The French oil major will inject equity into Rio Grande LNG, giving it the final push towards its June FID target and taking its overall contracted capacity to 86% from 64%. NextDecade, like Sempra, is holding discussions with banks to secure project finance.  

If NextDecade declares FID in June, we expect the share price to rise sharply to the low teens by end of summer, yielding a 100% potential return.

12xdbv7,DD,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

12woh5b,DD,Week Ended April 21 - Recap and thoughts for next week- valuation model update - are bears losing?,"**Market-moving News**

*1.	Bond market started to price in the “higher for longer” narrative but not the stock market.* The probability of a 25 basis point hike in May is now at 89% (last week I said it should be 100% when it was 66%), and the 2024 year-end Fed rate estimation has increased from 2.99% to 3.13%. However, the market-projected Fed rate path still suggests a 1% rate cut within the year and another 1.2% cut next year, which creates a large gap between market expectations and the Fed schedule, greatly affecting stock valuations (more details in the next section). 

https://preview.redd.it/pdiipbvxrova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=235c5b91e978482e15656c833868ab827c0c88c0

On the inflation front, this week’s data is a mixed bag; overall, things are cooling, but there are some warning signs that the disinflation process may not be a smooth ride. You can find all the charts in my daily post, and the table below provides a summary.

https://preview.redd.it/4lbrlp5msova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16ea8cb2d93baf9ffc0118e13daf817bfa3d09bc

*2.	Major economic indicators were also mixed last week, with four releases showing confusing results.* However, as mentioned in my daily post, ""things are bad, but not all bad."" For now, it seems safe to say that we are not at an imminent risk of a recession. Here is a summary of the manufacturing-related indicators/components:

https://preview.redd.it/kghldy13tova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52abca5da684948c8399973198cc83c429dc9446

Clearly, things are improving. Even the Philly Fed data wasn't that bad; many components were down year over year but improving compared to March. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) still looks bad, but that's based on March data. The Flash PMI showed signs of expansion, but the business outlook was still negative, and both input and output prices rose sharply, which is bad news for inflation.

3.	Earnings are better than expected so far, but still mark the largest earnings decline since Q2 2020. As of last week, 18% of the S&P 500 had reported earnings, and 76% beat estimates by an average of 5.8%, both below the 5-year average (77% and 8.4%). On the revenue side, 63% beat estimates by an average of 1.8%, both below the 5-year average (69% and 2%). Margins declined to 11.2%, the lowest since Q4 2020. For Q2 guidance, only 14 companies had given guidance, and 9 gave negative guidance compared to 5 positive. Analysts' 2023 full-year EPS estimates were slightly higher at $220, but 2024 EPS was slightly lowered to $246

**My positions and predictions**

***US Equity***

*Valuation*

I use a forward PE model, and here are the analyst estimations:

2023 Full Year EPS: $220

NTM: $227

2024 Full Year EPS: $246

Current SP500 forward PE is at 18.2, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. However, given the extreme QE situation of the past few years, these averages (especially 5-yr average) may not be the best point of comparison. If we compare current stock valuations to those of 2019, they don't appear to be very expensive.

https://preview.redd.it/voaozyw7uova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb5cd01ef80629686892f8d0988845e4c6da7f58

If you break it down by growth vs value and MegaCaps, the valuation doesn’t look bad either. We are still at 2019 levels, and in fact, growth's forward PE is lower today.

https://preview.redd.it/e3wdomx8uova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=665ee60e7755f3e82a57e4478c30f7191e05d460

But here is the parameter that really reflects the gap between market expectations and reality: risk premium!

https://preview.redd.it/ry2p7ijqxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77e51427f18c3ea32287467e0bb3450144820300

https://preview.redd.it/bqfs0imrxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a14bedaabbdfcb9c1da7c45c6a8282649b6f8769

The reason why the S&P 500 is priced at such a high forward P/E multiple is probably because the market is expecting rate cuts this year. As I mentioned in the last section, the market is still projecting a 1% cut this year and 1.2% next year. While I am not sure what’s going to happen next year, based on last week’s upbeat economic data, I certainly don’t expect rate cuts this year, and definitely not as much as a 1% cut! Therefore, I think the “higher for longer” narrative is starting to be priced into bond prices, but certainly not into stock prices yet.

The 10-year average risk premium is around 3-3.5%. If we use a 3% risk premium for valuation, today's stock should have a forward PE of 15.4. Given that NTM EPS is $227 and 2024 EPS is $246, the SPX should be at 3495 today and 3788 by year end (although it might be higher since the T-bill yield is expected to be lower by year end).

*Now let's look at what's lying ahead:*

*Tailwinds for stocks:* 

Cooling rent and inflation: Service CPI is currently the biggest problem for inflation, and rent is 60% of the service sector. Last week, rent increases finally crossed over to negative territory. The Fed uses a lagging rent indicator that tracks the 6-month average of rent changes, so we should have seen the peak rent CPI, and the April number may surprise to the downside.

Diving LEI on Fed: LEI has been a very accurate indicator in suggesting a recession. Unlike Empire State and Philly Fed, which are surveys and have a lot of noise, LEI is based on actual data. Historically, when LEI is at this level, we have a 100% chance of entering a recession. So, this number should carry good weight on Fed decision-making going forward. Especially if ISM (to be released on May 1st) is telling the same story, the Fed might decide to pause at their May meeting. I put this in the tailwind, but a recession eventually might not be good for stocks (I will discuss more if May ISM drops again).

Stronger than expected earnings: Q1 earnings so far have been pretty good at -6.2% YoY instead of -6.7% YoY as estimated. If this trend continues, analysts might dial up their full-year EPS estimations, which is good for stocks. The stronger economic activity showed in the Empire State and Flash PMI reports also supports better earnings in Q2. Although this might also indicate that inflation could pick up again, or at least be stickier than the Fed anticipated, so not a 100% tailwind either.

Investors are extremely bearish on equities and bullish on bonds: Unless there is some really bad earnings or economic data or a really hawkish Fed, the pain trade-up (or moving sideways) will probably continue.

*Headwind for stocks:*

CB liquidity tightening on track: We might have or about to reach the peak of CB rate tightening, however, most of the CB balance sheet tightening has not even started yet. I mentioned in my post multiple times that global liquidity correlates very well with stock performance and is a leading indicator. But do pay attention to two CBs, PBOC and BOJ. These are the only two CBs that are loosening their liquidity, and both have a deflation problem instead of an inflation problem.

https://preview.redd.it/lml8tv9wxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e076d732f40962bd102fda781fac4730f6a8828

Debt ceiling: The debt ceiling has never been a real problem. Anytime the market falls because of the debt ceiling, it turns out to be a good buying opportunity. But this year's problem is that it's coming a lot faster than anticipated. With declining tax revenue and a higher budget deficit, the debt ceiling might come in less than two months. Even though I still don't see how either party could allow this to happen, the derivative market (chart below 1-yr US debt CDS) and bond market (people rushed into 1-month bonds) are apparently freaking out a little bit. But not a single fuck was given in the stock market.

Credit crunch: Even though it feels like the bank crisis is already behind us, the impact has not yet manifested. With the majority of banks increasing their lending standards (especially regional banks, who are losing deposits at the fastest pace in history), more and more small businesses are finding it harder to get a loan. As a result, the number of companies filing for bankruptcy has passed COVID levels. If the Fed continues to hike, this could get ugly really quickly.

https://preview.redd.it/8mlymncyxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=091e0b9a21a552f6de2e334afed506220ed0187e

Resilient economy on Fed: As I mentioned earlier, some of last week's economic data showed that both US and global economic activity are beginning to recover. This might not be a good sign for inflation, and remember that the Fed's goal is 1% GDP growth and 4.5% unemployment (we are at 2% and 3.5%, respectively). An early recovery means the Fed has to hike more and for longer to bring the inflation down. Obviously not good for stonks.

To sum it up, stocks are pricey but not at an extreme level using the forward PE model. Other models like the PE, PS, and PEG models also lead to the same conclusion (data not shown). The risk premium shows that the market has not fully priced in the ""higher for longer"" narrative and a pull back seems appropriate. The majority of tailwinds have already been priced in, as implied by yield compression, but most headwinds have not been, which could lead to higher yields or a recession, and in turn, a pull back in stock price. Overall, I see limited upside for stocks from here, and a pullback might happen soon. However, the current data do not support a major recession in the near future, as I wrote about in Friday's post. US family and business balance sheets are in great shape, with lots of cash and low leverage.

**Update on my year-end projection:**

Base case (orange): No changes from last week. In 2023, SP500 earnings are the same as 2022 ($220), and 2024 earnings are up 10% YoY (the historical average is 7.8%, but given how resilient the US economy is, I still think 10% is appropriate). Inflation will stabilize below 4% and continue to decline. The Fed will schedule 1-2 fewer cuts by the end of 2023 than what is anticipated today.

Bull case (green): Reduced earnings estimation based on Q1 results so far.  In 2023, SP500 earnings are up 5% YoY (to $231 based on Q1 results so far), and 2024 earnings are up 10% YoY (to $254; current analyst estimations are at $246). Inflation will stabilize below 4% and continue to decline. The Fed will schedule the same number of cuts by the end of 2023 as anticipated today (Dovish).

Bear case (red): Increase earning estimation based on Q1 results so far. We hit a mild recession with a 5% earnings decline in 2023 but expect to swing back to $225 in 2024 (7.5% growth). Inflation will be well under control, but the Fed will schedule 1-2 fewer cuts by the end of 2023 than what is anticipated today but will increase the pace in 2024 (hawkish).

The light blue box indicates where we are today. If we use the 10-year average forward PE ratio, 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use the risk premium model, we should be close to 3500.

***US Treasury Bond (TLT)***

My view on TLT remains the same as last week. The ""higher for longer"" narrative is not fully priced in, so short-term TLT will still be under pressure. But on the other hand, unless inflation is out of control, Fed cuts will be gradually priced into TLT throughout the year. Range movement is likely in the next few months, but once the Fed is clearer about the cut schedule, TLT will start to climb.

12vbbyp,DD,My Match for 2023 (really this pun?),"For the sake of boredom right from the start: A bit more than two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Ovid devoted three complete books to the art of love. Quite pragmatically, Ovid begins by explaining where men should go to ""hunt"" for women: in the circus, at horse races, on triumphal marches, at feasts, or on the beach. Aside from the fact that triumphal marches and gladiatorial fights are rare these days, Ovid's handbook didn't really lose its relevance until a few years ago. But then the digital revolution changed our love lives. In 2012, Tinder launched a platform that reduces the search for a sexual partner to its most basic components: visual attractiveness plus basic information about occupation and status. A boon for some, sometimes cruel, but undeniably efficient. How did potential sexual partners find each other before Tinder? Sometimes through friends, sometimes at work. But the traditional place to meet was out on the town. Let's face it, finding sexual partners is one of the main incentives for going out at night. A plan that in reality only works for a few, and if you soberly calculate the success rate, it is a rather inefficient approach for most. And an expensive one at that. You start the evening with a few drinks, get about 30 minutes of that precious window of time when you are loose but not yet slurred, until some degenerate contemporary orders the first round of shots. Anything after that is almost always a waste of time from a dating perspective. The next morning you wake up alone, ashamed and afraid to look at your bank account.

Shareholders of Match Group, Tinder's parent company, have had a rough time lately. Tinder has, unsurprisingly, failed to maintain revenue compared to the second pandemic year of 2021, and competitors (such as Bumble) have challenged its market position. But is stagnant user growth really such a problem? Tinder has been a household name for years; everyone knows the platform. It should come as no surprise that user numbers can't grow indefinitely. A dating platform like Tinder naturally cannibalizes itself; ideally, two users will find each other and delete the app (at least for some time). But that shouldn't scare investors away. Every year, new cohorts reach Tinder-ready age, and at the same time, the age limit of those who get involved with dating apps like Tinder increases every year. I think Tinder can increase its profitability without increasing its user base. First, it can cut costs and make processes more efficient (as recently as February 2023, Match Group laid off 8% of its employees). In addition, paywalls are becoming more commonplace for any kind of internet service these days, and at the same time, people are becoming less reluctant to pay for such services - Tinder Gold is still cheaper than going out every weekend. It's a bit of a stretch, but the tobacco industry has become increasingly profitable in recent decades, despite declining user numbers, thanks to significant productivity and efficiency gains. Tinder is also attacking its main competitor, Bumble, with its new dating app Hinge, which has seen significant user growth (yes, Hinge also competes with Match Group's own product Tinder).

I realize that I will not get much support for this DD. Especially since I did not find it necessary to summarize and evaluate detailed fundamental data here. But sometimes it is good to just follow the old KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid): Match Group owns Tinder, the iconic dating app - a social network, so to speak - that virtually everyone knows. It also owns Hinge, which could be the next big thing in the dating app market. Match Group is currently valued at $9.7 billion with a PE of 13. Meta, Facebook's parent company, is valued at $547 billion with a PE of 22. That makes Meta about 56 times more valuable than Tinder. I can't help but find that odd.

**This is not financial advice.**

**The Fed**

The Fed needs to raise more, a lot more, at this moment, right now! 2023 US tax revenue is trending down about \~30% compared to 2022, but the US deficit is expected to exceed 2 trillion this year. Here is what’s bothering me: with the US government on a spending spree, how is the Fed supposed to tighten? The Fed is on schedule to shrink their balance sheet by 60 billion per month, which is less than 1 trillion a year. However, the US government is basically injecting 2 trillion a year into the system. I don’t see how liquidity can ever go down.

https://preview.redd.it/foiz1q4d4bva1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=031d7b2ef487d846fbae77c8fed02371603e52b5

Just a reminder that the Fed is only expecting 1% GDP growth this year and a 4.5% unemployment rate. So far, we are tracking 2% GDP growth and a 3.5% unemployment rate. The Fed is very far from done.

**The Economy**

This week’s economic data is confusing, to say the least. We got Empire State roaring higher on Monday, then Philly Fed face-slapping bad, and conference board LEI puking yesterday. But how can you end the week without another jumping surprise from SP Global flash PMI? Today’s data showed both manufacturing (11-month high) and service (6-month high) jumped to expansion territory. New orders are at an 11-month high, job growth is solid, and prices are higher too. JPMorgan said, “The April flash PMI showed unexpected and broad-based improvement, suggesting further positive momentum in the US economy, a more sustained pace of expansion, and tighter monetary and credit conditions do not appear to be significantly slowing activity at this time.”

https://preview.redd.it/tt0x627j4bva1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f76cc6f62bcb07b11f33e41296f37c9e147e8fc

So I was trying to find out why consumers and businesses are so resilient in a tightening environment. And look what I found: 

***Savings, so much savings.*** 

US household savings are still sitting at a historical high. And not just a little high, but 4X high! From 1 trillion before the pandemic to close to 5 trillion today.  You mfs keeps whining about inflation but look at how much cash you are hoarding!

Even though the saving rate is down from 10% before COVID to 5% now, the absolute dollar amount is still higher than before COVID!

Corporate, on the other hand, has a cash position declining much faster, but still higher than before the pandemic.

The interest coverage ratio (calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax by the cost of a company's debt-interest payments) is declining rapidly but still higher than before the pandemic. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is declining too, indicating that US companies are deleveraging (taking less risk).

Looks like it’s going to take the Fed a lot more rate hikes for a much longer time to bring inflation down.

&#x200B;

**The Business**

MSFT, META, AMZN will report next week. 

""With tech ownership super concentrated, results to come in these stocks are critical if this equity market is to hold. MSFT and NOW next week will be huge tests in my view. They do not have to be big beats or raises, they need to be clean and stable."" - JPM

Big techs are last year's biggest losers who turned out to be this year's biggest winners. Funds are looking for stability and safety. It’s not that the market is overlooking risks, but rather that all the risks are priced into small caps.

Natural Gas prices have close to Zero chance of touching past all time lows and will never fall again if you look at current technical setup and future outlook for Natural Gas. The all time lows were because of lockdown. There is no reason for prices to touch all time lows now or come close to breaking all time lows.

Even with high Natural Gas storage reports in the United States, there is a deficit soon due to an extremely hot summer. Natural Gas is used by commercial facilities to cool during the summer in addition to heating during the winter. Injection season where Natural Gas is added to storage will NOT be enough even though there are claims of close to 5 year average highs. Natural Gas Intelligence and other news outlets are all pushing BULLISH articles.

Shorts have been eliminated including hedge funds. Algos have switched position to be all in in Natural Gas which means very likely good news for BOIL. Volume indicates this.

BOIL is going to be in a likely massive uptrend for the following months.

Commodities expirations is on 4/25. Watch what happens after today's options expiration 4/21 and 4/25 to BOIL. The FED interest rate hike will have Zero effect on Natural Gas prices. Raise another next month and the month after. 

Watch the Natural Gas prices recently, they have stabilized and not breaking down technical supports and especially $1.97 in past couple weeks, so don't think about breaking all time lows anytime soon in the future.

12tzpq0,DD,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",Badboyardie,3,0.63,2,0,0,2,0,2023-04-21T12:10:21Z,False,False,t2_24hau26v,667,2051,162,473,2019-02-15T23:52:47Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12tzpq0/volume_tickers_in_play/

## 🎩 Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Have a Magical Flavor ✨

Darlings, let me tell you about the mystical world of technical analysis and indicator-based trading. They're like fortune tellers, using the past to predict the future! 🔮

Now, our magical analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that, we can calculate portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma being the stars of the show. 🌟 Once we have those, we can simulate changes in greeks at different price points. This is where the real magic happens! ✨

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, or sometimes both. It's the reaction from these price levels in the past that drives our trading signals. 📈

Now, our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which reflects the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. Many of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock, and the best plays benefit from both the directional move and the increase in IV. 🎯

## 📜 Notes - A Wrinkle in Time

If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious, my dear. Something has changed since these plays were generated. Remember to sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest at your discretion. Risk up to 1% of your total capital on any trades you take, or less if your conviction is lower. And keep in mind that the trades were calculated before market open, so new price movement may invalidate the original thesis. 🌪️

## 🦉 FAQ - Wisdom from Madame Zeroni

* Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? 🐻 No, darling. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays? 🎭 No, my child. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like, and get that gain porn. 🚀
* What about new plays on the same ticker? 🔄 The new play should replace the old play, as the old play is likely now invalid.
* Where are the crayons? 🖍️ Click the links above, sweetie.
* Have you back-tested this? 🧪 Yes, with a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error).
* What is the historical performance? 📚 Realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31) 📊

Well Tesla broke through some MAJOR supports here… outside of a hug recovery back over 167 tomorrow by EOD… I really like a short on Tesla with a target of 150.1 then 133.9.

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

We continue to try and work through the rebalancing on SPY daily supply/ demand right now… We had a previous Supply at 411.04 that we did indeed come down and take out today… next target is 409.73 supply followed by 409.18 demand. If we break through those levels and close we would then start to target 406.61 demand and 405.17 supply. 

My ultimate target and where I hope to sell my 92dte puts is 399.07.

We are seeing price action signal a downside move now and we are attempting to break extreme momentum on SPY daily. 

Something I will touch more on tomorrow night is that we are also attempting (if we hold here at close tomorrow) to turn this 412.63 weekly double top into a new supply… That would mean we have taken out 409.98 weekly supply and can begin targeting 385.9 demand down below… granted I don’t think we will get that low its where our target would be until a new weekly demand comes in. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7op19zdh14va1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9985cf00a2e4614d02097bf60b798d04d8d42798

We for the first time in almost a month of trading have officially closed a daily candle below the 8ema… this is the first step in a bearish reversal… however, until momentum is fully broken and starts to push down we could still see the 20ema bounce us which should be right around that 409 price area tomorrow. 

We also have a new breakout triangle forming here at 412.2 resistance and 408 support tomorrow. 

The bears ideally want to see this close under 408 tomorrow and under the daily 20ema… IF we get that closure then I would start targeting 405.2… However if we close back over the daily 8ema tomorrow at 412 then realistically upside target would be the 414-415 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 409.7 -> 405.2  
 Demand- 409.2 -> 406.6  
 Support- 409.6 -> 409.1 -> 408  
 Resistance- 412 -> 414.2

I have said a few times now I prefer watching supply and demand on the daily for futures as the price action is far more smooth then SPY… this continues to be the case and I continue to see 4178 supply as a key resistance. With a closure under the daily 8ema we should once again start to target 4116 demand. IF we break through that level we have a pretty steep descent to 4040/4055. 

Weekly wise we are attempting to establish a new 4173 supply which takes out current weekly 4149 supply and makes our downside target at 4055 supply.

We once again broke pretty much the last support I see from this bull run up today. With this support being broken we will now look for the daily 8ema to turn into resistance and we will watch this new black resistance line. 

Target should remain the daily 20ema which will hover right around 4120 tomorrow. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4178 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4116  
 Support- 4152 -> 4118  
 Resistance- 4173 -> 4198

I saw someone compare the VIX in 2008 to current VIX and thought I would look for myself… now past does not predict the future BUT if we analyze these two charts there is a case to be made that the previous peak on the VIX we hard in March is the peak of July 2008… and that the September VIX bottom is our current bottom… IF that is the case then the major leg down is about to start…

VIX broke through resistance today and closed a nice doji… however, failed to close over the daily 8ema once again. We will watch that key 17.1 level and 17.74 level tomorrow… a closure over the 8ema to end the week could bring a bearish move next week…

I had a pretty decent day trading today.. as you can see mid day today I got really chopped up… I had saw the reversal conditions forming on the 5 and 15min chart around 1pm and I was attempting to get in on it. Of course I got stop loss hunted 2 times in a row and took some small profits on the way down… I missed out on that whole leg down as I kept waiting for a good reentry that didn’t feel like chasing. 

I was very salty getting stopped out and then it immediately rejected back to a profitable spot. But that’s the name of the game. We cant always and wont always get every move and our timing as much as we try to be perfect will never be perfect every single time…. But in the end we put in a really nice profitable day again today…

Disclaimer: *I am only posting this yearly update as a way for me to journal my thinking and for future bragging rights (or to become an eternal WSB* 🤡). I am documenting my way to an 8 digit portfolio by the end of the decade.

Fellow degens,

Here is my **yearly 4/20 update** on holding $ASTS ([AST SpaceMobile](https://ast-science.com/)). Safe to say, if you had bought last year at $8 \[[4/20 Update 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u7s7lm/the_gamechanger_in_mobile_broadband_connectivity/) \-- I invite you to read it for some context\] and held until now, you would be down >45%. Ouch. You would have underperformed (euphemism) both SPY and QQQ by a wide margin over the past 12 months... Ouch (twice). At least, I did. Ouch (again).

However, you would have had plenty of opportunities to sell along the way at $9 in June, $14 in August and $9 in November. And this would have put you well ahead of the indices last year in a down market. It has also outperformed it's peers (deSPACs are down c.60% over the same period and space-related deSPACs have mostly become pennystocks -- a few exceptions exist).

Although, I have been proven wrong so far (return-wise) and feel I jumped the gun too early. I continue to believe this is a company to follow closely. Here is why.

# Recap of last year, where I was wrong and where I wasn't

Last year, I had identified four categories of risks: launch, technology, funding and regulatory.

**I was wrong**. The launch didn't happen in June 2022 but was delayed to September 2022 (not the first time there is a delay with the company). However, **I was right** in guessing that the company had really well engineered it's deployment system and everything went out smoothly.

**I was right**. The technology to connect the satellite directly to an unmodified phone works ([CEO tweet](https://twitter.com/AbelAvellan/status/1647643784291704832)). I am expecting a formal event in the coming months to announce it with AST's partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc.).

**I was right**. There seems to be a huge market for the service. Mind you. Last year, nobody was talking about D2D (direct-to-device) -- it was deemed impossible by industry professionals (just like landing a rocket was deemed impossible). Now, Apple/GSAT, Starlink/TMUS, IRDM/QCOM are all working on the opportunity. Do you think a trillion dollar company and multi-billion ones would do that if there was no demand?

That's a paradigm shift I didn't expect. Also, I believe AST to be a few years ahead at the very least (after the recently announced delay by Starlink and Samsung not adopting QCOM's solution).

It also seems like the FCC is doing a full 180 on regulations to accomodate for this new market. Something to watch closely.

**I was wrong**. I didn't see how shit the market would become and how difficult it would be to raise money in last year's environment. I am certain the constellation will get funded, too many stakeholders want to see it happen. Yes. **I was right**. Last year, AST had 17 partners under agreement and now they have **35 agreements covering more than 2bn people**.

# Is the risk/reward still as good?

At today's price, I still believe it could be a multideca-bagger and why not dream a little for a 100-bagger (it's valued at <1% of Starlink, yes Starlink, not accounting for SpaceX) by the end of the decade.

On the risk-side, we now know the technology works, they are able to deploy the satellite and close the connection. Remember. **This was something even industry professionals thought was impossible**.

Moreover, there has been no insider sales (not even the SPAC sponsor -- find me another company where that is the case). The last insider buys were at $5.5 and I am sure it's nice to buy below them (offers some comfort on the downside).

The technicals seem to indicate that we have double-bottomed.

# What's next?

There is a regulatory ruling by the FCC tomorrow (4/20).

As mentioned earlier, I expect an event of some sort with AST's MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, etc.).

I expect hard contracts and funding arrangements to follow or be announced at such an event.

A successful test launch of Starship (highly unlikely) is a small bonus as it will signficantly lower cost of launch.

I still think this is not for everyone. I believe that I shall be fine hodling long term. I know that for most of you long term is 5 hours and the only fundamental research you do is based on price action over the past week.

Risk of this going to 0 is still significant and it has been a dud so far.

# Position

I bought 2,000 more shares since last year. 42,000 shares ([proof\_1](https://ibb.co/XDWkSBL) \+ [proof\_2](https://ibb.co/RHH1Px7))

TL;DR: Well, I am one year older and still full of cum. The reward is identical to last year but now with less risk as the technology has been proven. Still a **potential** 100 bagger by the end of the decade -- only company I know who can immediately tap 2bn customer once service becomes live.

See you next year.

12swnm5,DD,"The Algorithms are set to buy BOIL today, tomorrow, and into next week regardless of any bearish Natural Gas EIA report release","There is a pattern that happens at premarket and goes through the day for Natural Gas where we see rangebound trading where prices might look bullish or bearish, but the price has been trading between a range of about $1.99 and $3.05 based on about 8sma, 21sma, and 50sma looking on different timeframe for 8 hour, 4hour, 1 day, etc.

It is hard to discern whether Natural Gas is bullish or bearish.

One factor people think Natural Gas is bearish is EIA report released every 1030 am on Thursday and after looking at the pattern for the past few days, point out that even if USA is over the 5 year average supplied for storage report, there is still a massive shortage. Doesn't matter if the injection season has 10000% surplus because there is still a shortage, look at the Pacific region, and record hot summer in the United States will tap into shortage in addition to  dwindling supply of Natural Gas in EU by winter due to record hot summer. Don't forget, Natural Gas is used for cooling purposes by manufacturing and big facilities for the summer in addition to warming in the winter.

Just wanted to get this message out during premarket, because if you don't read this and see it, watch the price action of Natural Gas today, tomorrow, and going next week. 

As Natural Gas futures contracts get bought up, BOIL the leveraged etf for Natural Gas will likely go up since based on tracking of Natural Gas futures contracts. Yesterday might have seem like short covering but look at the volume. The algorithms look like they're all buying today, tomorrow, and into next week regardless if the data release of the Thursday Natural Gas EIA report for United States show good storage numbers for Natural Gas",curiouscat248,26,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,2023-04-20T12:14:28Z,Edited,False,t2_w2g77p1p,6,34,6,34,2023-03-03T04:31:02Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12swnm5/the_algorithms_are_set_to_buy_boil_today_tomorrow/
12svwcq,DD,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",Badboyardie,2,0.72,5,0,0,5,0,2023-04-20T11:47:29Z,False,False,t2_24hau26v,667,2051,162,473,2019-02-15T23:52:47Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12svwcq/volume_tickers_in_play/

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons are the Schrute Special 🌈

Forget beets, folks. We're about to dive into the delicious world of crayon-based technical analysis, where the colors are as vibrant as my love for karate. 🥋

This analysis is a secret recipe, combining the finest option open interest with a pinch of portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma, to be exact. It's like a beet salad for your portfolio, minus the dirt. 🥗

Once we've mixed our greeks, we can simulate their change at different price points, finding those sweet spots where portfolio-level gamma is maxed out and delta is closer to 0 than Jim is to being Assistant Regional Manager. 📊

Now, some tickers react like a Schrute at a beet auction—strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, or both. These reactions are the secret sauce that drives our trading signals.

The plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, as sophisticated as my Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager hat. 🎩 The best plays benefit from the directional move and the increase in IV, just like how I benefit from the absence of Jim's pranks.

## Notes - Wrinkling Your Brain Like a Beet Leaf 🧠
If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious—something changed, like the time Michael tried to cook bacon in his bed. 🥓 Adjust your position accordingly, and remember, I risk up to 1% of my total capital on trades, but if my conviction is lower, I'll allocate less and dollar cost average in. 

## FAQ - Because Ignorance is as Annoying as Toby 🙄
**Q: Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear?**
A: No. These trades are like a Schrute family reunion—some form of mean-reversion toward or away from an important price level.

**Q: Are you entering all these plays?**
A: No. I'm sharing these plays like I share my beet knowledge—generously. Pick the ones you like, and get that gain porn.

**Q: You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?**
A: The new play replaces the old one, like when I replaced Jim as Assistant Regional Manager. Don't chase the price—embrace the new data.

**Q: Where are the crayons? I only see words.**
A: Click the links above, my friend. 🖍️

**Q: Have you back-tested this?**
A: Yes, like I've tested the durability of my nunchucks. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate, with a 7% margin of error.

**Q: What is the historical performance?**
A: The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31)

Now, go forth and trade, like a true Schrute. Remember, fortune favors the bold, and the beet farmer. 🚜",hardyrekshin,10,0.8,17,0,1,17,0,2023-04-20T00:43:54Z,False,False,t2_icqm0,374,3896,125,2776,2014-09-11T17:23:34Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12sg8pc/20230420_wrinkle_brain_plays_in_the_style_of/

12s9361,DD,4-19-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis (Bonus- Tesla Earnings),"  

Well one would have assumed after a major support line was broken and we had a -0.5%+ open… that we would see some bearish continuation… but instead just like the last almost month now it was one again a buy the dip type of day… we did end up with a decent bearish reversal EOD though. 

**TESLA EARNINGS**

Initial reaction here is barely down 1%... however, everyone knows the conference call is what matters…

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/je6he0tciwua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79adbedd41e2a3666e569e0e54966ce1ccea7495

Well I had mentioned yesterday that there was a major imbalance in the markets and that I found it odd to establish a new supply which should be a resistance below current price… well today we just did a very bullish thing and we turned that 414.1 Supply into a new demand (support). Now this also becomes an issue here… 

Why? Well we established a new Demand… which should be a support however, that demand was established above current price action and actually is exactly where we found resistance EOD today. 

So this is where things get choppy and hard to really find direction and make sense of it.. we should push to the next supply which is 415.36 and 417.03… however, we could drop to previous supplies below at 411.04 and 409.73. 

We are for sure in chop right now. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hl7s4kbdiwua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1d52404ea5699f9be3585bd58ecc8e303adc126

Now we break through the rising wedge that has been support for over a month now. That should in and of itself be a very bearish omen for the markets… However, we once again bounced hard off the daily 8ema. The trend has officially broken… but we continue to hold the daily 8ema… Lots of chop and no continuation. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 409.7 -> 411 -> 415.4 -> 417  
 Demand- 414.2 -> 409.2  
 Support- 412.1 -> 409.1  
 Resistance- 414.1 -> 415.6 -> 416.8

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

This is where it is very helpful to watch futures and SPY at the same time… Futures shows a slightly different picture then SPY… what im seeing here is that yes we DID bounce hard off the daily 8ema but what we got stopped in our tracks at 4178 supply… IF we were to get a huge green day tomorrow we could potentially turn 4178 into a new demand (support) which would be extremely bullish. However, if this 4178 resistance holds right now then we start talking about a push back to 4116 demand. 

One other thing that happened on futures is that we did take out 4160 and 4154 supplies today. However on SPY we did not take out any previous supplies. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

We also broke the rising wedge and put our 4th daily doji in a row in… there does appear to be a 4198 rejection and possible carrot top forming here… 

With the daily 8ema still holding as support that pretty much is the last support to watch before we start the next leg down… this decent miss on Tesla COULD start the next leg down. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4178 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4116   
 Support- 4154 -> 4139  
 Resistance- 4178 -> 4198

**VIX**

The VIX once again put in a new 52 week low… and not only that this current level the VIX just hit is as low as the VIX was the last time SPY was at an ATH… 

On paper and realistically and logically (haha) the VIX daily broke its massive falling wedge and SPY/ Futures broke its rising wedge… those two doing that together SHOULD signal a sell off on Spy is imminent… but the market has proved us to be irrational. 

I still overall remain bearish and still hold my 93dte 405P which are down about 16%. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

A pretty decent day of scalping and trading today… I got chopped up pretty good mid day when we were fighting aggressively at 413.5 for so long. Days like today become increasingly frustrating to trade and we once again held a less than $3 range all day. 

I have had a lot of people ask why I went back to SPX… 

I predominantly for anyone who has been following me for a long time traded SPX 0dte all of 2022… I killed it on scalp game… however once 0dte evertday SPY and SPX hit the markets honestly 0dte just weren’t it anymore…

I know others have had the same issue but there was this detachment of SPX premiums (mostly 0dte) and actual SPY/ SPX movement… meaning often times I would enter and have a good entry and SPY WOULD move down (if I bought a put) however, my put would actually lose value… there were also other times where it seemed like we got a huge move in premiums when SPY wouldn’t even move… 

I got away from 0dte and when I did that I went back to SPY (mostly cause SPX was too expensive due to the VIX being so high AND spread on further out SPX are not as favorable). Well recently I have worked my way back down to 2 dte and now im back at 1dte… this means I was trading on average 10-15 contracts of SPY every trade and burning a lot of commission every day… I am temporarily using SPX now because 1. It saves on commission (only 2 contracts vs 10-15)… 2. Its 60/40 tax benefits and 3. SPX has a way of moving that if you learn it can be very favorable to option buyers. 

In all reality trading SPY or SPX is one and in the same… smaller accounts (those buying less than 10 contracts at a time) really would benefit from SPY and I honestly think SPY options move better and easier than SPX does… but anyone trading 10+ contracts should seriously look at SPX… just be mindful of the spreads if trading further than 0-1DTE.",DaddyDersch,33,0.89,43,0,0,43,7,2023-04-19T20:30:33Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s9361/41923_spy_es_futures_and_vix_daily_market/

12s2zqb,DD,What to do for Tesla's Earnings Tonight,"Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q1 2023 financial results today after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management are scheduled after the results. These tend to move the stock big time, so the stakes are high for investors and degens like us. Options will definitely be fun to play with.

In this post, we’ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.

**Tesla Q1 2023 deliveries**

As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q1 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company’s revenue. Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that [it delivered a new record of over 422,000 electric vehicles during the first quarter of the year.](https://electrek.co/2023/04/02/tesla-tsla-confirms-q1-2023-record-deliveries-beats-expectations/) Tesla also confirmed having produced 440,000 vehicles during the quarter – also a new record. Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results.

**Tesla Q1 2023 revenue**

For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $23.617 billion, and [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/sectors), the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $24.048 billion.

Despite the new record number of deliveries, these estimates would represent a quarter-to-quarter decrease in revenue due to Tesla’s implementing large price cuts during the first quarter. Lower prices are probably a smart strategy considering higher interest rates, the potential for economic deceleration in 2023, more competition, and the new rules for tax credits under the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it). Nonetheless, it would be a massive year-over-year increase from $18 billion in revenue in Q1 2022.

Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/t7l4Nyj.jpg

**Tesla Q1 2023 earnings**

Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now. For Q1 2023, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $0.85 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $0.94 per share.

The estimates have a wide range this quarter because of the price cuts Tesla implemented during the quarter. Analysts and investors are looking to see how badly it is going to affect Tesla’s margins and, ultimately, its profits. Unsurprisingly, Tesla achieving the Wall Street consensus would be a big drop in earnings quarter-to-quarter, and the automaker would be flat on earnings year-over-year.

Here are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/rlj48di.png

**Other expectations for the TSLA shareholder’s letter and analyst call**

The obvious thing is the gross margin. Investors are going to be looking for that number first. They want to know by how much it dropped and how much room there is since Tesla continued to drop prices after the end of the quarter. If Tesla can stay in the mid to high teens, I think investors will be happy, but if it dips lower than that, they might have a problem. Investors will also be looking at insights from management about the pricing strategy, which seems to be changing fast.

Tesla shareholders will also be looking on an update on [Cybertruck production](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23571806/tesla-cybertruck-volume-production-delay-2024-q4-2022) as the start of production gets closer, but knowing Tesla management, I wouldn’t expect much more than it being on track for a start of production this summer and volume production next year. Cybertruck should not have a material impact on Tesla’s revenue in 2023.

I assume that amid margins going down, Tesla investors are going to want to have an update on [Tesla’s self-driving program](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/autopilot), which has helped margins in the past, but the program has been stalling for a while now.
 Shareholders will also be particularly interested in Tesla Energy this quarter and its potential future impact on Tesla’s financials. It has been a growing business for Tesla and with a [ramp-up in Megapack production](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/teslas-investor-day-ramping-up-the-megapack-business/), it should be bigger in Q1, but I wouldn’t expect a massive jump in deployment until the second half of the year. We will see what Tesla has to say about that.

**Trading Tesla Stock: Technical Analysis**

Trading Tesla stock is not for the faint-hearted. Shares have [produced sizable annualized volatility of 64%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=TSLA&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=SPY&allocation2_2=100) since inception. In plain English: as much as investing in the S&P 500 is risky, investing in TSLA has historically been nearly five times riskier!

Of course, the possibility of even more intense price moves, either to the upside or downside, gets magnified around earnings day. To help figure things out, Wall Street Memes recently published a strategy for [trading Tesla stock](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/tesla-stock-the-charts-send-a-clear-message).

To recap, TSLA has been struggling to break free of the 200-day moving average to the upside ([see here](https://i.imgur.com/S3SqpCf.png)). The good news is that selling pressure should ease each time that the stock gets denied further gains at the moving average, as the pool of sellers at that level shrinks.

If or when Tesla stock overcomes the hurdle, there is the possibility that a $300 price target set by the next key resistance level would open up a huge opportunity for bulls. Getting there from current levels implies a gain potential of over 60%. Such a move may sound like wishful thinking, but keep in mind that TSLA is all about high-risk and high reward. Earnings day is important because it could present the key catalyst that confirms the viability of the bullish trade – or rejects it at once.

**So what to do for earnings?**

For all the reasons above, I think it would be reasonable to get a strangle on Tesla. For the noobies, a straddle is an options strategy where we buy both a call option and a put option on the same underlying stock with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is typically used if we believe the stock price will experience a significant price movement but is unsure of the direction. Grabbing the 4/21 190c and 170p doesn't seem like a bad idea. The stock will certainly move.",CalmGains,33,0.71,13,0,0,13,0,2023-04-19T17:05:28Z,False,False,t2_8vyhj5k4g,15,304,10,106,2023-04-09T17:30:16Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/

Predictions are April 28 or EOM for vehicle certification by regulators to begin sales. Magna is notably a more established manufacturing partner than its competitors are using.

12rsxj3,DD,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #035: Oracle CEO Sells $470M, Apple CFO Sheds $11.5M | Ackman Snags More $HHC | Insider Trading Recap","GM WSB -

TL;DR - Relatively large jump in purchases this past week ($9.7M / +460%), though overall buys remain low compared to insider sales ($1.4B / +103%). Insider transaction activity declined from the prior week, with only 190 companies / 277 insiders submitting Form 4 filings.

The buyers were, once again, funds: Ares Management ($4.2M, $FYBR, Telecom Services) and Ackman’s Pershing Square ($1.3M, $HHC, Real Estate - Diversified). Both appear to be “set it and forget it” bids as their % change in ownership from the transactions were both < 1%.

There were a few CEO purchases pushing 6-figures:

* Scott Myers, Viridian Therapeutics ($VRDN): $101,479
* Thomson Leighton, Akamai Technologies: $100,175
* Steven Brass, Wd 40 Co: $99,927

And today I learned that WD-40 operates as a standalone company.

# Notable sales from insiders:

* Catz Safra, the CEO of Oracle ($ORCL / Software - Infrastructure) sold 63.24% of their common stock stake in a **$181M sale** on April 12th. **Another $288M** in common stock was sold on April 10th.
* Sessa Capital Fund, a 10% owner of Provention Bio ($PRVB / Biotechnology), sold 12.34% of their stake in a $53.2M sale on April 14th
* Sanat Chattopadhyay, an EVP at Merck & Co ($MRK / Drug Manufacturers - General), sold 100% of their stake in a $15.4M sale on April 13th
* Luca Maestri, the CFO of Apple ($AAPL / Consumer Electronics), sold 39.4% of their stake in an $11.5M sale on April 13th
* Todd Simpson, the CFO of Seagen ($SGEN / Biotechnology), sold 41.32% of his stake in an $11.3M sale on April 10th
* Bruce Sachs, a Director at Vertex Pharmaceuticals ($VRTX / Biotechnology), sold 34.07% of his stake in a $6.9M sale on April 12th

# Notable buys from insiders:

* David Daniel, a Director at Domo ($DOMO / Software - Application) purchased 47,500 shares of stock in a $684K purchase on April 13th
* Tanner Geoff, the President, and COO of Simply Good Foods ($SMPL / Packaged Foods) bought 6,912 shares in a $250K purchase on April 10th

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $1.7M to $9.7M (+460%)
* Sales increased from $700M to $1.4B (+103%)
* Transactions decreased from 481 to 326 (-32%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 257 to 190 (-26%)
   * Net buyers increased from 9 to 16 (+78%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 248 to 174 (-30%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 431 to 277 (-36%)
   * Net buyers increased from 11 to 22 (+100%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 420 to 255 (-39%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **April 10th - April 14th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 3rd - April 7th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind Form Fore

## Trading Baaahsis - Why These Crayons Taste 🤤

Baaa, even I, the sheep, can be a brilliant trader! 🐑 Let's dive into my colorfully decorated trading thesis.

Technical baaanalysis & indicator-based trading use past prices like Mary used little lambs 🐑🐑 to predict today's hotspots 💥.

The calculations are based on today's option open interest, kinda like counting sheep (or was that sleep? 🤔). Factoring in Delta 👍 and Gamma 🔄, we set up our portfolio-level greeks (like gods of trading, you know 💸). I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points like my dancing skills at the pasture disco. 🕺

Turns out, some tickers can really tickle those delta-neutral and gamma-max sweet spots. 🥳 Using the past as a woolly map, we drive the trading signals 🚦.

Gotcha some plays and target entry prices 🎯 calculated with a binomial option pricing model that reflects the size and duration of the reaction to gamma max or delta neutral. The finest plays become a woolly blockbuster, benefiting from the trendy move and increase in IV. 🚀

## Notes - Something to give you that sheepish grin 😏

* If the price has already jumped, 🚸 caution! It's like racing past the sheep flock, careful not to miss anything important. 🐑
* Sell half ✌️ while the pasture's green & roll the rest to exit whenever you please. 🌈
* Risk up to 1% of capital on trades, but if you're feeling sheepish 🐑, try 0.5% or 0.25% & DCA in. 💰
* Trades were calculated before market open - remember, a lot can change by sunrise! 😴🌅

## F-BAA-Q - Because ewe've already asked.

* Mostly puts, are you a gay 🌈 bear 🐻?
  * Baaaaah, no! It just so happens there's room for some mean-reverting action after recent run-ups.
* Are you entering all these plays? 🎮
  * Nah, just sharing my woolly insights. Pick & choose what suits your baaanalysis. Let's get some gain porn! 💪
* New play on the same ticker? 🎭
  * Out with the old, in with the new! 🔄 Don't chase price, think of it as a new sheep arriving in the pasture. 🐑
* Where are the crayons? I only see words 🎨

12r5nm5,DD,"Watch out! Natural Gas has reached all time floor at $2.35 & Likely to go up a lot more from here, pay attention to BOIL","Natural Gas prices bounced off $2 recently from a tiny hint of cold weather towards the end of April. Everyone said Winter is over, but a tiny hint of cold weather has sparked Natural Gas prices.

Boil is an leveraged etf that is based on Natural Gas futures

Natural Gas is slated to rise and unlikely to fall from this level now or ever.

There a few reasons for this which are mainly close to empty Natural Gas storage in the United States. Yes, articles say there is a surplus compared to 5 year average, but all these articles have posted recently that a little bit of heat in the summer will turn this into a deficit if you include the massive exports. A lot of people don't know but Natural Gas is used in the summer by companies to cool buildings. All the articles came out at the same time from places like Natural Gas Intelligence, pointing to deficit soon.

There is massive demand from EU. EU has the same issue that a hot summer would massively screw their supposed surplus since there is no more Natural Gas from Gazprom from Russia

There is massive demand from China from China's reopening from lockdowns.

Freeport LNG is exporting massive tons of Natural Gas. Look up twitter posts of satellite images that show vessels going out.

FED's policy has failed in bringing inflation down, stagflation is likely which means massive commodity spike in prices. Have another Interest Rate hike, zero effect on Natural Gas prices.

A lot of you were burned by BOIL because you didn't know when to invest.

There is close to ZERO chance that natural gas will go down from here. 

There are twitter posts with charts to prove this and also youtubers coming out of the woodworks who called it wrong now all confirmation biasing this rise in Natural Gas.

If any of you disagree, would like to see some plausible reasons.

12r45cv,DD,"4-18-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Daily Market Analysis (NFLX earnings and BONUS Tesla Earnings Preview and TA)","Despite an impressive nearly $3 intraday drop and a straight drop for the first hour of the day… we once again found ourselves in a downtrend that consolidated before an EOD breakout… I will say today felt different though.. but still was in the end a “bullish” day. 

Actually the fact that we are closing today green (granted barely green) but had that morning sell off doesn’t feel right. Today intraday felt far more bearish than the day actually closed.

I did NOT play a position on Netflix (I have a pretty hard set rule NOT to trade earnings…) but I would have eyed some 310 puts on Netflix… as of right now that would have paid out impressively well.. See how this holds in the morning. 

Netflix has a way in my opinion of shaping the future of earnings for tech… Next up is Tesla tomorrow…

Tesla is expecting a 6.4% move per IV for tomorrow and actually interestingly enough their EPS is predicted to be fairly low compared to the last few earnings only predicting us to be 0.85. I still do not recommend any earnings plays but I am putting out the information for others. 

**BONUS TESLA**

I don’t usually include tesla but including it today for a freebie as many have requested it return… its not staying but since earnings are tomorrow lets talk about it…

Weekly wise we have been holding this red channel of 166.94 to 208 since the week of January 23rd and we have now formed a massive breakout/ breakdown triangle… one could actually infer that this triangle is a massive bear flag too… Now if we see Tesla break below 181.3 by EOW then we are breaking that support and I would see that as a fairly tempting short play and honestly a closure under 166.94 would be further confirmation of downside… I would start to target 150.1 and 133.26.

However, IF earnings come in good and we get an upside pump then key resistance is 203.08 followed by confirmation at 208 EOW. For me I actually would be fairly tempted to play a 30-60dte call or put in the direction of Tesla post earnings… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dditpy3eipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39cfdef28ed041e4fbe3e327a460e021e02ba92d

Interesting day today… we FINALLY got a new supply put in. With a new supply put in at 414.1 (just below previous 414.13 supply) we now start to target 411.04 and 409.73 supplies. However, this is where we are once again in a weird pattern here.. we established a new supply which should generally be seen a resistance… however the way today opened and moved actually put the supply in lower than todays close which actually makes this a support area to watch… This is where things get complicated and we have to be careful… 

While a new supply means we look to retest lower supplies and target previous demand (support) which currently is 411.04 -> 409.73 and 409.18… when market is imbalanced like this we could actually bounce form here and attempt to immediately turn this 414.13 supply into a demand (support) which would be extremely bullish… Turning a supply into demand or a demand into supply is an extremely strong move. 

Spy is still in extreme bull momentum and the daily chart still is setting up for reversal conditions… however they are not quite perfect just yet…. Daily 8ema should still attempt to hold as support… if and when we lose that daily 8ema is when it will be time to look out below…

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/13ounfkeipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73195cad18cd132ac09dc42d1dd78b0d72e63b68

The price action here on spy daily actually perfectly held the resistance line of that red rising wedge at 415.7 however, once again we had a bigger bounce off the low with no bearish continuation and that led to this lower end wick… 

The rising wedge continues to come to a tighter point here which very well could come to an end tomorrow… generally speaking rising wedges are bearish reversal patterns and when formed with this cup and handle potentially here on the daily… we are looking at a hard top with a bigger drop possible… 

Key support is 413.9 tomorrow and resistance at 415.9.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 414.1 -> 415.4 -> 417  
 Demand- 409.2  
 Support- 414.1 -> 412.4 -> 409.6  
 Resistance- 415.6 -> 416.9 -> 419.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

Today we also saw a new supply put in on futures daily at 4178… this is a major level to watch as this is a resistance level that dates back to February. 

Now with this new supply here and being that futures is far more balanced than SPY daily (another reason I like watching both) this shows that we could easily see a retest of 4160 and possible 4154 support (previous supplies) tomorrow or later this week. Our target here should be previous demand at 4116 if we can break through those 4160/4154 levels.

Like I mentioned 4178 is a major level and you can see yesterdays rejection there was a major rejection for the 3rd time (With a candle body). Now interestingly enough we did pump over night and touched 4198 and nearly perfectly rejected it… not only that but we now have formed a rising wedge inside of the rising wedge. 

Currently blue rising wedge support sits at 4160 for tomorrow (which is a supply level) and resistance sits at 4200 and then 4218. 

The one thing that is clear as we have tested this 414+ area and 4160+ area is that we have come into some heavy resistance. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4154 -> 4160 -> 4178 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4116  
 Support- 4152 -> 4139  
 Resistance- 4200 -> 4236

**VIX**

I continue to remain impressed that the VIX goes lower and lower… 

The VIX, formally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, measures how much volatility professional investors think the S&P 500 index will experience over the next 30 days. Market professionals refer to this as “implied volatility”—implied because the VIX tracks the options market, where traders make bets about the future performance of different securities and market indices, such as the S&P 500.

Above is a reminder of exactly what the VIX is… now lets talk about this for a second…

Over 40% of all S&P-related options are now same day expiry (Source: Optionmetrics), or “zero-day-to-expiry” options, shorthanded as “0DTE”. Ten years ago this number was about 5-10%. The daily volume of 0DTE contracts on the S&P 500 (SPX) increased from around 400,000 in January 2022 to approximately 1.2 million in March 2023, representing a three-fold increase in daily volume, according to data from OptionMetrics.

What does this mean and why does it matter? Well this is just my opinion and gonna be a bit of a tin foil hat/ rant moment… We are starting to see days where the VIX is red (dropping) and Spy is red… and we are also seeing a lot of times now where SPY is going on a sell off only to see a huge EOD recovery… 

What is causing this and why are we getting tiny movement and no continuation? 

My opinion here is that we are seeing a few things happening… with this massive spike of 0dte options big money is playing options intraday and they are getting their instant hit and then through the rest of the day taking that OI off the boards and often times causing huge recoveries when they do so… 

Why are we not seeing continuation? Well the underlying VIX is not rising… why? Well no one is going short with long DTE… everyone is trading 0dte or similar net short positions… there is no more of these longer DTE contracts that take a week or two to play out… but according to many articles and analysts… big money is the most net short since 2011 and 2018 (depends on the article)… but how could the VIX be in the 16s which by all means is a bull market level? 

Well this is my thoughts… Markets are pretty much being set up to get slaughtered here soon. Why? Well what is happening is that markets once again do not believe jpow… they believe we are getting 100bps of rate cuts by EOY… but that’s not going to happen (as of now according to JPOW)… markets are “forward looking” but there is a lot to be said that they are too forward looking right now… plus we know historically its time to sell the last rate hike… Now if that was last meeting (if jpow changes his tune) but most likely that will be this May 3rd meeting… IF that is the last rate hike (if JPOW hard hints at this) then we are likely seeing a top on SPY and we are going to start to see some heavy downside… 

Now much like a month ago in march when we had the Bank run… we had huge spikes in the VIX… why? Well markets FINALLY thought there was a reason to not only sell… but to continue to sell as they thought we were apart of the next great financial crisis (we may still be)… however, quickly the VIX would dump… why? Well markets no longer believed that was the case which has led to this rally…

Honestly we are in for some pretty serious pain for the next 2 weeks unless earnings severely tank the markets. Now if earnings come in bad and give bad guidance (or recession hints) we might start to see the VIX push back up leading into FOMC… but I think we might be in some pain sitting in this 400-420 area for the next few weeks until FOMC and CPI… Markets need a reason to sell off and to continue to sell off and they just have not had that reason yet… 

0dte options has forever changed the game.

Today I experimented with using 1dte SPX options again… if you have been following me for a while you knowing I used to love SPX 0dte scalps and level to level plays for all of 2022… however, come November when 0dte everday hit the markets the game changed forever… we were left with some extremely choppy and awful premiums… I had moved to further dte because we were having issues of entering and basically immediately being down 5-7%... getting stopped out and then seeing a huge move… it also was not entries and we were seeing premiums moving outside that of actual price action… 

Well I did experiment with some 1dte SPX today and so far I don’t hate it… I will continue to monitor this over the next week or so and see if I want to stick with 1dte or go back to 2dte SPY… The biggest thing I did notice today though was that mid day consolidation that the 1dte premiums got ate up extremely fast and often times led to being correct on the move and direction but finding ourselves losing value as the play moved in our direction.",DaddyDersch,31,0.89,65,0,0,65,11,2023-04-18T20:58:27Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12r45cv/41823_spy_es_futures_and_vix_daily_market/

12qxya3,DD,What to do for Netflix Earnings Tonight,"Netflix is scheduled to [report first-quarter earnings today](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/nflx). Investors are going to look for clarity on the company’s next steps regarding rules on password sharing, global price cuts, and the success of the new, lower-priced subscriber tier that features adverts.

In November, Netflix launched [its ad-tier to users in the U.S](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/announcing-basic-with-ads-us). This gives subscribers the option to stream their favorite shows, with the inclusion of advertisements for a lower price. This was meant to help the streaming giant attract new subscribers, or hold on to existing ones who might be struggling as inflation continues to run (Thanks Brandon).

In February, [Netflix started to implement new rules in different countries to regulate password sharing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/02/24/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-kick-people-off-account/11332667002/) in an attempt to bring in more revenue. The company has said that more than 100 million households were sharing accounts, affecting its ability to invest in programming. However, it's not like they're entirely banning account sharing - but rather they're looking to boost its monetization of account sharing. The company has introduced paid sharing of accounts in some Latin American countries last year, it expanded these tests to Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain in February. Also in February, reports came out that the company had [lowered monthly subscription prices in more than 100 territories](https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/netflix-price-drop-affects-more-than-10m-subscribers).

Citi analyst [Jason Bazinet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-bazinet-7766aa5/) wrote in a research note that earnings might look confusing this time around considering all the changes the company has made recently, but he encouraged people not to overact to this quarter's key performance indicators or financials - and keep their eye on the prize. I'm pretty  sure most analysts are on the same page as Jason here. Netflix is still very much a growing company, and this earning report is going to be an indication of it. Especially when most groups are offering a ""buy rating"" for Netflix, with price targets as high as the 400s. 

From [Buisness Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-q1-earnings-preview-1032236417): 36 analysts predict earnings of $2.86 per share as opposed to earnings of $3.53 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Wall Street is expecting the company to report $8.17 billion, an increase of 3.89% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $11.46, while the previous year saw a profit of $9.95.

Last earnings Netflix popped up 4% after they reported fourth-quarter results that showed healthy gains in subscriber growth. Over the last 1 year, NFLX has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time.

Given all this information, it would be reasonable to go for a Netflix call spread. A 4/21 330/340c is only $340, which may offer ~3x gains if Netflix goes up about 5% tonight.",CalmGains,37,0.74,18,0,0,18,0,2023-04-18T17:46:48Z,False,False,t2_8vyhj5k4g,15,304,10,106,2023-04-09T17:30:16Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12qxya3/what_to_do_for_netflix_earnings_tonight/

## Jokin' Thesis - Why Elmo's Crayons Taste Yummier 🌈

Techy analysis and those blinky indicator thingies usually look at past prices to guess important prices for today. 🤓

This smarty-talk is based on current option open interests. With those, it figures out big Greek stuff—like Delta and Gamma 💥. More excitingly, once we got our big Greek team all set, now we can imagine what'll happen at different prices. Then, we find out where our Greek pals are the strongest and closest to zero. 🎉

For some tickers, the prices go zoomy with Delta-neutral, Gamma-max, or even both. 🚀

How prices moved in the past guides our trading signals for today. 🚦

Our plays and target prices are calculated with a fancy-schmancy model that shows how big and long the reactions from Gamma-max or Delta-neutral will be. Many of these plays win with just the stock moving. The bestest plays score from the direction AND the increase in IV. 🎯

## Notes - Give your brain a tickle 🧠

* If the price zipped past the entry price, watch out! 🛑 Something changed between the time these plays were made and market open.
* Sell half your stuff when it doubles, then let the rest do its thing until you're ready to exit on your terms 😎.
* I use up to 1% of all my coins on any trades. If I'm less sure, I might just use 0.5% or even 0.25%. Then I use the ""dollar cost average"" move ✨.
* These trades were figured out before the market opened and are based on yester-yay's info. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter way after the fact 🌟. New moves might make the old thesis go bye-bye.

## FAQ - Elmo Gots the Answers 🌟

* Most of these plays are puts. Are you a grumpy bear? 🐻
  * Nah 🤪. It's just that these companies had a big party recently and might be a li'l too party-tired. These trades mostly help things settle down or move toward important prices.
* Are you in on all these plays?
  * Nope 😅. I searched far and wide to find more plays with a good chance of winning to lead us to gain-town 🚀. Go through the list, pick your faves using any extra smart stuff you know, and let's win big!
* You said there's a new play on the same ticker from before. What's up with that?
  * The new play kicked the old one out. ⚽️ If you haven't joined in, don't chase the price. Remember, new data came in, so the new play uses it, but the older play doesn't.
* Where are the crayons? Elmo only sees words. 🖍️
  * Click the links up there ⬆️.
* Did you test this in the past?
  * Oh, yes! Results show a not-too-shabby Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a winning chance of 63% of trades (plus or minus 7% just 'cause) ✅.
* Gimme some history! 📜
  * The real deal Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 and we won 68% of the time. Based on trade performance so far, there's a 95% chance the win rate will be between 63% and 75% (cool fact from 2023-03-31) 🏆.",hardyrekshin,10,0.83,18,0,0,18,0,2023-04-18T00:54:48Z,Edited,False,t2_icqm0,374,3896,125,2776,2014-09-11T17:23:34Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12q4518/20230418_wrinkle_brain_plays_in_the_style_of_elmo/

# So what the fuck does this mean

The thesis is simple. Most everyone was wrong about  Rumble's market share and thus its value.

Rumble has proven YoY growth exceeding other existing viral products like Tik-Tok, and now it has reached critical mass exceeding **80MAU (Monthly Active Users)** which means it's reached brand recognition phase and has massive momentum that should only continue i.e.

# It's a snowball rolling down a hill

Anyone who is already a content creator or elsewhere now must recognize the value on uploading their content to Rumble as they are currently paying out more in order to gain market share.

This means the brand and its userbase has now reached a size where its own size is helping it grow.

&#x200B;

Currently that would mean from the basic ass analyst's prospective the stock looks overvalued

(2.6B/340M) \~7.5x P/B (Price to book ratio)

20M a quarter at conservative growth call it 100M

(2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio)

# But fuck that shit

# They've got this all wrong

Let's talk about the sector they're in

20M/Q , call it 80M for 4 quarters for 'instantaneous annualized' revenue

With 80MAU this is 1 ARPU (average revenue per user)

# Why is ARPU so low?

\[link removed\]

&#x200B;

>**Disney+** global ARPU was **$4.30** in Q1, Domestic was $6.32 (subscription)  
>  
>**ESPN+** ARPU was **$4.73** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
>  
>**Hulu** SVOD ARPU was **$12.77** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
>  
>**Netflix** global ARPU was **$14.91** in Q1 (subscription)  
>

>  
>**Paramount** domestic ARPU of “around **$9**” in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
>  
>**Peacock TV** ARPU was “around **$10**”, in Q4 2021, no Q1 2022 number given (subscription and advertising)  
>  
>**Roku** ARPU was **$42.91** in Q1 (trailing 12 months), which is $3.57 a month (advertising)  
>  
>**fuboTV** “Advertising ARPU” was **$7.11** in Q1 (their long-term target for Ad ARPU is $15-$20)  
>  
>**Vizio** ARPU was **$23.68** in Q1 (trailing 12-months), which is $1.97 a month (advertising)  
>  
>**Starz** domestic ARPU was “around **$5.70 to $6**”, in May 2021 and Lions Gate hasn’t updated it since then (subscription)  
>  
>\*\*Discovery’\*\*s overall D2C ARPU was “**around $7**”, with Discovery+ ARPU of “more than **$10**”. These numbers are from July 2021 and Discovery hasn’t broken out ARPU since them. (subscription and advertising)

Current figures are pretty close to the above

The most similar product is YouTube had about $29B in revenue in 2021 and about 2.68B MAU this means **ARPU is $10-11**

It's reasonable to suggest Rumble's ARPU will change greatly from \~1 to at least 5-10

But why is ARPU \~$1 now?

It's simple, Rumble is paying out hugely to its users to incentive growth for the snowball effect

So earlier when it was stated (2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio), the market is really pricing in an ARPU of around 4 to give an actual future P/S of 6:1 which is more in line with these type of companies

&#x200B;

Another more fundamental prospective to consider is Revenue Per Minutes of Engagement

YouTube Reportedly Does 1B a day , this is \~30.5B hrs watched/month

Rumble Does 11.1B Minutes a month, this is (/60) \~ 185M hrs watched/month

YouTube reports \~29.24B in annual revenue, this is about $2.44B /avg month revenue

Rumble reported 20M for 1 quarterly revenue, this is about  $6.67M /avg month revenue

Meaning:

YouTube's revenue is $2.44B/30B hrs **\~$0.08 /hr watched or $4.88 per minute**

Rumble's revenue is $6.67M/$185h hrs **\~ 0.036 /hr watched or $2.16 per minute**

**This 2.26x as much per minute of viewing** which is another multiple of at least 2 when monetization is made proper, the view time per user will go up as well once the platform is larger with more users and content.

# RUM is currently fairly/under priced given this adjustment

So really the relative metric looking forward should be **Marketcap Per User**

&#x200B;

YouTube is worth 180B going off about a 6-7 P/S ratio \[link removed\]

Tik-Tok is valued at Around 70B

FB+Insta Reels is valued at (3B Rev \* 6.5 \~20B) \[link removed\]

The total value of this marketspace is currently at least 300 B

**This is 115x the current marketcap of RUM**

(in a growing market as well, that will be much bigger than 300B in the future)

>The global video streaming market size was valued at **USD 372.07 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from USD **473.39 billion in 2022** to USD **1,690.35 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

# But that's just Videos and Clips

>The global web hosting services market size was **USD 75.03 billion in 2020** and is projected to grow from USD **83.99 billion in 2021** to USD **267.10 billion in 2028**, exhibiting a CAGR of 18.0% in the 2021-2028 period.

>The global cloud computing market size was valued at **USD 405.65 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from **USD 480.04 billion in 2022** to USD **1,712.44 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

\[link removed\]

The total marketspace for RUM's existing products is

About 500B expected to grow to about 3.5T by 2030

This is present **192x RUM's market cap** to **1340x RUM's Market cap in \~7 years**

# Here's some Price scenarios for you

Currently RUM is \~3% Video/Clips Market (going off 2800MAU vs 80M) and sub 1% on the other two despite having a few very large costumers and some other topics that will be mentioned soon

(2023) 0.03\*400B \~ 12B ------------------(**\~5x in share price w/ current market share**)--**(bear case)**

(2030) 0.03\*1800B + 0.001\*300B  + 0.001\*1825B \~ 56B marketcap (\~21.5x in share price)

&#x200B;

*Roughly doubling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(neutral case)***

RUM 6% Video Market + 1% Webhosting+ 1% Cloud services

(2023) 0.06\*400B + 0.01\*85B  + 0.01\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~12x in share price)**

(2030) 0.06\*1800B + 0.01\*300B  + 0.01\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~50x in share price)**

&#x200B;

*Roughly quadrupling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(Bull case)***

RUM 12% Video Market + 2% Webhosting+ 2% Cloud services

(2023) 0.12\*400B + 0.02\*85B  + 0.02\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~24x in share price)**

(2030) 0.12\*1800B + 0.02\*300B  + 0.02\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~100x in share price)**

&#x200B;

**Moderately Strong Bull case**

RUM 40% Video Market + 5% Webhosting+ 5% Cloud services

(2023) 0.40\*400B + 0.05\*85B  + 0.05\*500B \~ 189B marketcap (**\~73x in share price)**

(2030) 0.40\*1800B + 0.05\*300B  + 0.05\*1825B \~ 826B marketcap **(\~316x in share price)**

Probably a bit later than 2023 for these numbers

&#x200B;

Short term

Bear case for 2023-2025: is $50/share - **Bull case is $223 a share (24 bagger)**

Long Term

Bear case for 2028-2030: is $200/share - **Bull case is $940 a share (100 bagger)**

In my humblest of opinions

# Why Rumble

So how's Rumble going to get from 3% to roughly 10-15% marketshare ? Other than the thesis above which talks about the **Snowball...**

&#x200B;

Well my good regard, have you met this man yet?

Rumble is already peering with **Starlink** (Musk's world wide satellites providing Rumble with unstoppable infrastructure) and partnering with Trump Media. All has happened already publicly and officially.

# When Moon

Yes we all want to buy calls because RUM stock going back to NAV losing you about $8 of the $9 a share or going to $1000 a share in the next 2 years isn't enough risk symmetry already, let's try to time this shit like a good regard with call options. No one knows but here's some decent guesses for when the next legs up are

So it's basically a **11.50c 9/16/27** priced at 2.09 .. this is a lot better than regular calls in most situations

12pwrva,DD,"4-17-23 SPY/ ES futures, 10YR Yield/ DXY and VIX Daily Market Analysis (question about 0dte SPX Gamma Exposure)","\*Reposted due to mistakendly being removed from ""banned"" ticker in picture\*

Well after the weekend we opened pretty much flat as we could and with a pretty mixed bag from the markets today… we have officially found ourselves once again in the CHOP ZONE.

First we will start with the question of the day… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rnjuj1neiua1.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=26833e33ce9082f638ddb132ad6a13ab9c0262fb

There is this twitter account that pretty much exclusively tracks the 0dte gamma exposure (GEX) of 0dte SPX contracts… there is a correlation that has started to be seen with these massive EOD rallies and GEX changes… I wanna find out how to track GEX live. What I want to see is the GEX 0dte SPX… I wanna see when the numbers goes up and goes down live. IS there a way to do this? 

I am not sure how this person accesses this live data but if they have access to it then I know there is a way… I suppose he could have an indicator to analyze it live but that is something I can work on too… the question is how is he getting the data live? If you know how let me know. 

Honestly I just am still pretty shook that we can have the same trend for almost a month now of tight $2 ranges almost all day long followed by a range breaking $3-4 rally the last 2 hours of the day. It truly defis technical and logic. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/razjlijneiua1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54d755857510da0079efd18201269464b385544b

We until the eod rally once again were attempting to put in a new supply (Resistance) only to have that $2+ rally reset the indicator. We also once again bounce off the daily 8ema. 

We have officially closed 16 days ABOVE the daily 8ema… which is one day short of the longest streak which was from July 27th until August 18th which saw 17 days in a row CLOSING above the daily 8ema on SPY. 

We are now coming into previous supplies (Resistance) at 414.13 -> 415.36 and 417.03. If we close over 417.03 and do not see a retrace there is a fairly large gap in supplies (Resistance) from 417.03 all the way to 429.8. 

SPY is finding itself back in extreme bull momentum which does track with why the daily 8ema remains key support. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ttvy1p0oeiua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5f2a0e79b033f2c9c34f47e5320f55665cfdc48

Looking at daily price action here you can see we do have a rising wedge formed here which gives upside resistance tomorrow at 416.1. Today the bulls actually impressively bounced us directly off the black support line that dates all the way back to March 24th. 

Key support for the rising wedge remains at 412.4 tomorrow. 

I do still think this cup and handle is going to play out and there is still as I have mentioned for a few weeks now do see a potential to hit 416.9 resistance (previous supply) first before we see the cup complete. 

Price action EOD did directly hit 414 and reject. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 414.1 -> 415.4 -> 417  
 Demand- 409.2  
 Support- 412.4 -> 411  
 Resistance- 414 -> 415.2 -> 416.9

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jknmdhoeiua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e35c8b983ac7a795f39105ef8ac3d1acc57a2ef

Looking at futures here same story as we attempted to turn 4173 into a new supply however, ended up pushing up so far EOD that we no longer established a new supply. Futures is not quite back in extreme bull momentum yet though it is attempting to be and a green day tomorrow almost certainly would put it in extreme momentum. 

The daily 8ema also remained as strong support and pretty much for the last 9 days straight would have been the perfect place to open a long. 

We are now sitting between 4160 and 4198 supplies and should look to target 4198. IF we break through that then 4310 is the next supply I have. 

We continue to leave supplies over 100pts below and the higher we go without taking these supplies out the bigger the drop eventually will be to rebalance the daily. The biggest issue is there is no timeline for this. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zu3dgdyoeiua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39ddfa3bd9786997a79ff38e3228cc1a4da064e1

The most impressive and bullish thing from todays price action on futures is that we actually despite it being resistance all day and attempting to break and hold under 4150… turned 4173 resistance from Friday into support now. 

Bulls will look with this daily 8ema bounce to continue to rally us. Rising wedge resistance sits at 4210 and support at 4150 for tomorrow. 

Honestly I think the most frustrating thing about this whole move up and rally the last 2 weeks of trading is that yes we are making higher lows and higher highs but none of this trend looks or has felt strong at all… honestly if you could probably take the last 2 hours of trading out and would show a much different picture. 

These EOD rallies continue to provide bullish closures and technical while showing some of the weakest upside pushes I have seen in a while. 

I do still remain in 405p 95dte and I do still have little doubt in my mind that we will see 390-395 within the next 3 months… but this continues to be a buy the dip market. The other thing that has been frustrating is that for being 95dte these puts are getting crushed pretty fast and aggressively. The goal still remains to average down at 420 if and when we get there. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4198 -> 4160  
 Demand- 4116  
 Support- 4173 -> 4138  
 Resistance- 4193 -> 4237

**VIX**

This officially with the VIX closing at 16.94 today is the lowest closure the VIX has had since January 4th which was 16.91 and is the lowest level the VIX has been since January 5th when it saw a low of 16.58. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xlna9vgpeiua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d0e6a17b0bdd6446236bb46ab43356ecbf4c7d8

The VIX continues to be in this falling wedge pattern here and continues to break under the daily 8ema. With this closure under 17 today and a new 52week low we will look for the VIX to touch 16.55 support tomorrow. 

16.55 support has held as the lowest level since November 2021. IF we lose this level and the VIX unwinds again… then we can look for 15.03 which has been the lowest level of support on the VIX since February 2020. 

Honestly the fact that the VIX is this low right now is pretty astonishing to me.  The VIX is pretty much saying “this is a bull market.” Despite everything that we have going on and to come still… I don’t know if this is the biggest bull trap the world has ever seen or if we truly are just going to barely scrape by and slow burn painfully to a new ATH over the next 2 years. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ie2dczypeiua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b494412b0466db292dde955d10058f5931527fb6

One interesting trend today that I did notice and I did mentioned last week and ALMOST had me sold that we were about to start the leg down was that DXY has bounced and officially broken its bear channel resistance that was established beginning on March….

Why does that matter? March 8th which is the peak was 3 days before the bottom of the current bull trend on SPY was put in…

Something to watch… if DXY continues its uptrend it should continue to bring the market down outside of other bank issues and unforeseen conditions. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/58rmkvbqeiua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e243ec795989ab92657bac39a5950b6dd78667e

Similar trend here on the 10YR as we were in a huge breakout/ down triangle that now has found a breakout… this too should provide further upside for the 10YR and further downside for the markets. 

The 10YR broke through a pretty strong resistance level of 3.587% and now will look to break through 3.646% and 3.704%. 

The one thing I will say about this is that for most of the day today we saw for the 2nd day in a row the VIX red while SPY was RED. 

The market doesn’t seem to know what technical it wasn’t to follow half the time… some times its moves with the 10YR, DXY or VIX… there is just a complete and total lack of follow through in the markets right now. 

Remember guys… capital preservation… there will be the next bull market (easy mode) your goals to survive until that happens… There will always be a light at the end of the tunnel… 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I mentioned Friday I swang some 0dte (today dte) SPX 4135puts… At the time of opening those puts IV was around 7-8% (I cant remember exactly) and when market opened today IV on SPX was near 21-22%... I saw a near 3x of IV and a red open (granted VERY small red open) yet I was faced with a red open on my put. Highly frustrating the way premiums have been moving lately. 

I got chopped up pretty good early morning but was able to turn it around mid day after going 2 for 5 and turning in 11 out of 12 plays green in a row. 

Overall a green day and a good start to my week but a highly frustrating day that truly lacked continuation and general respect of the technicals once again.",DaddyDersch,39,0.84,41,0,0,41,9,2023-04-17T21:05:00Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12pwrva/41723_spy_es_futures_10yr_yield_dxy_and_vix_daily/

12pleen,DD,Update on LUMN,"Im pretty sure im not the only one getting fucked by LUMN right now, im down 60% and sold calls for 2 years out.

I sold the calls even after they cut dividends because they already had a good free cash flow and now with the dividend cut there is a bigger upside possibility.

**Here are my key arguments:**

* They borrowed a lot of money in 2017 but are paying their debt massively.
* Their price to sales ratio is 0.1x which better than the estimated 0.6x.
* Based on SimplyWallstreet analysis (Discounted Cash Flow model) they are 63% undervalued.
* Telecom earnings growth is 14.9%.
* Their Earnings growth rate is 87.2%.
* Their EPS growth rate is 73.9%.

**Here are my concerns:**

* Their current ROE is -14.83%.
* Their forecasted return on equity for the future 3 years should be 1% compared to industry 7.9%.
* They still have a lot of debt.
* EPS is -1.54.
* Gross Margin is 54.98%.
* Net Profit Margin is -8.86%
* Debt/Equity Ratio is 194.7%.

**Here is what i want to see on next earnings (May 1st):**

* Further guidance on restructuration and debt repayment.
* Possibilities of going private?

**Summary:**

* Upside is huge, at this point, **its a real degen gamble**...

12pd6nz,DD,Stormy Waters: Technical Analysis Reveals Bearish Patterns in the Banking Sector,"[Impact of the Banking Crisis, Recession Fears, High Valuations, and Interest Rate Hikes on Banks' Price Action](https://www.savefortuna.com/post/stormy-waters-technical-analysis-reveals-bearish-patterns-in-the-banking-sector)

The banking sector is currently facing a number of challenges, including the risk of recession, high valuations, interest rate hikes, and fears of inflation. These challenges are reflected in the price action of many banks, which are currently expressing bearish patterns.

Technical analysis of multiple banks reveals that many are currently presenting bearish patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops, and ascending channels.

>“The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.” - Warren Buffett

A Sector In Crisis

One factor contributing to the bearish sentiment in the banking sector is the ongoing banking crisis, which has been brought on by multiple bank failures and concerns about the stability of the financial system. This crisis has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and tighter lending standards, which are putting pressure on banks' profitability and growth prospects.

Additionally, fears of a recession are also weighing on the banking sector. A recession would likely lead to increased loan defaults and reduced demand for banking services, which could further erode banks' earnings and asset quality.

High valuations are another headwind for the banking sector. Many banks are currently trading at relatively high price-to-earnings ratios, which suggests that investors have high expectations for future earnings growth. However, if earnings fail to meet these expectations, investors may begin to sell off bank stocks, leading to further declines in price.

Finally, interest rate hikes are also a challenge for banks. Higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, which can reduce demand for loans and other banking services. Additionally, higher rates can also put pressure on banks' net interest margins, which can reduce their profitability.

Technical Analysis

It all started with an article on [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/)

. As usual, I was curious to see what kind of trajectory their stock was on. With a tendency of being contrarian, and Q1 bank earnings coming up, I decided to do an analysis of some of the major banks to see how they may be affected by the current banking crisis. Usually, I expect price action to be in line with major data points and headlines, in the hopes of finding discrepancies. It is these discrepancies that highlight opportunities in markets. What kind of discrepancies do we look for?

1. Fundamental Discrepancies: Traders might look for discrepancies between the fundamental analysis of a company and its current market valuation. For example, if a company's fundamentals suggest that it is undervalued but its stock price is declining, this could be an opportunity for traders to buy the stock.
2. Market Condition Discrepancies: Traders might look for discrepancies between the current market conditions and the direction of a stock's price. For example, if the market is bullish but a stock's price is declining, this could be an opportunity for traders to buy the stock, expecting it to rebound as the market recovers.
3. Technical Analysis Discrepancies: Traders might look for discrepancies between the technical analysis of a stock's price chart and its current market valuation. For example, if a stock's price chart shows a bullish trend but its current market valuation

So What Do We See?

An ""**M top**"" is a bearish chart pattern that occurs in technical analysis. It is characterized by two peaks that form a letter ""M"" shape on a price chart. The pattern occurs when a stock or asset price reaches a high point, then pulls back to a support level before rising again to a similar high point. However, instead of breaking through this resistance level, the price falls sharply, creating an ""M"" shape on the chart.

A ""**break** of a trendline"" occurs when the price of an asset moves below or above the trendline, indicating a potential reversal in the trend. A break of a trendline can be significant because it can signal a shift in market sentiment, with buyers or sellers gaining control of the market. For example, if a stock has been in an uptrend and then breaks below its trendline, this could indicate that the buying pressure has decreased, and the stock price may start to fall. Conversely, if a stock has been in a downtrend and then breaks above its trendline, this could signal a reversal in the trend and a potential buying opportunity.

An ""**ascending channel""** consists of two parallel trend lines, with the upper trend line connecting the highs and the lower trend line connecting the lows. The upper trend line acts as resistance, while the lower trend line acts as support. As long as the price stays within the channel, it is said to be in an uptrend.

If the price of an asset breaks below the lower border of an ascending channel, it can indicate a potential trend reversal. A break below the lower border can be seen as a sign of weakness in the uptrend and could signal a shift in market sentiment toward bearishness.

In technical analysis, a **head and shoulders** pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs on a price chart. It is formed when a stock or asset price rises to a peak, then declines to a support level before rising again to a higher peak (the ""left shoulder""). The price then declines again to the same support level before rising once more to a higher peak (the ""head""). Finally, the price declines again to the support level before rising once more to a lower peak (the ""right shoulder"").

The head and shoulders pattern is significant because it indicates that the bulls (buyers) have failed to push the price higher, and the bears (sellers) have gained control of the market. When the price falls below the support level, it confirms the pattern and signals a potential reversal in the trend. Other bearish signals that can be seen (described above) in the chart are an ascending channel (bearish) and two trendline breaks (Bearish when the trendline is broken to the downside). Third time's the charm?

Technical patterns (Ascending channel and M formation, both bearish) have already been described above.

Technicals include bearish ascending channels with trendline breaks. There is even a faint head and shoulders pattern at the end of the most recent price action.

Conclusion

In conclusion, technical analysis of multiple banks suggests that the banking sector is currently facing significant headwinds, including the ongoing banking crisis, fears of a recession, high valuations, and interest rate hikes. There has also been a recent slowdown in lending due to the recent credit crunch, which you can read about in my previous [post](https://www.savefortuna.com/post/top-5-items-under-20-i-can-not-live-without)

12okfl9,DD,"Don't worry, BOIL will not reverse split, Natural Gas WON'T stay low","There is some worry for the natural gas etf, BOIL, would reverse split, but the price has to go low enough for that to happen. But the issue is that Natural Gas prices won't go lower & CAN'T go lower than $2 or stay there reasonably  


When you factor in inflation for food and other items, Natural Gas at $2 is cheap since an inflation adjusted basis should be $5 or $6 for Natural Gas, not $2  


There are tons of reasons to be bullish for Natural Gas in short term and long term such as major storage deficit in coming months due to torching summer heat in the United States and EU, China economy reopening and sucking up all Natural Gas available, Ukraine and Russia war forever war, Freeport LNG exporting all of Natural Gas globally, Inflation not ending due to Fed's bad policies, and all the algos buying up Natural Gas to dump all other sectors in the stock market.  


So in short, don't worry, BOIL will not reverse split and with the past trading days, we have seen all the shorts exit and Natural Gas will rise, watch out for the gap up Monday, next week, and next months. If Natural Gas goes low, statistically improbably, it can't stay low, so Zero chance of reverse split",curiouscat248,82,0.61,11,0,0,11,0,2023-04-16T18:42:58Z,False,False,t2_w2g77p1p,6,34,6,34,2023-03-03T04:31:02Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12okfl9/dont_worry_boil_will_not_reverse_split_natural/

***Inflation continues to moderate although core inflation is somewhat stubborn.*** Wednesday’s CPI data came in slightly below expectation, however looking at breakdown, the biggest declines came from used car (-11%) and gasoline (-17%). Core CPI is still sticky, which mostly coming from shelter (+8%), but based on real time rent data from Apartment listing and Redfin, we might have past the peak.

PPI declined more than expected on Thursday. Biggest decline also came from energy. Core PPI increased 0.3%, unchanged MoM. The encouraging news came from service PPI which was -0.3%.

&#x200B;

Looking ahead to April, we might see CPI and PPI bounce up again. Both used car price and gasoline moved higher in by the end of March and in April. Confirmed by both Inflation Expectation Median 1 Year Ahead Expected Inflation Rate (NYCNM1IR) Index (raised to 4.7%) and U Michigan 1 Year Inflation Expectations Survey (raised to 4.6%). But good news is import price and transportation cost - Freightos Baltic Index (FBX) are both still declining.

As a result, bond yields rose this week in response to a higher rate for longer possibility. 2024 year-end Fed rate estimation raised from 2.77% last Friday to 2.99% today.

&#x200B;

***Earnings season started with a bang as 4 major US banks reported stellar results.***  Financial sector jumped 0.7% on the good news, but rest of the sectors did not join the celebration. Earnings so far this quarter has been better than historical average. However, SP500 NTM forward earnings estimation continue to be slashed by analysts and now at $216 vs. $218 LTM. Now that CPI growth is higher than PPI growth (mostly likely will continue), corporate earnings might benefit from it as margins will expand.

***Mixed results on the economy, but global liquidity is on the rise since the beginning of the year.*** WEI index which mostly tracks GDP seems bottomed out and tilted up in April. Same as Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimation. However, both wholesale (MoM 0.4% vs exp. 0.6% for the month of Feb) and retail sales (MoM -1% vs exp. -0.5% for the month of March) were lower than expected.

March wage growth rebounded as well, adding more pressure to inflation. But a different outlook came from BoA’s deposit data where salary and waged continue to decline yoy and is already well below inflation rate.

If you are looking for reason that fueled this year’s rally, look no further than central bank’s liquidity level. Thanks to BOJ, PBOC (China credit impulse) and the Fed (due to bank crisis in March), global liquidity has been rising since the beginning of the year, correlated well with stock market rally. The liquidity injects from CBs might also stop ISM and LEI from further declining into recession levels. Definitely something we need to keep an eye on.

# My positions and predictions

**US Equity**

I changed my year-end valuation method from PE to forward PE. The results are similar.

https://preview.redd.it/gn01kekjs4ua1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55f35b48151059ccd8a6997747aff50b1116bb0b

***Base case (orange):*** Assume 2023 SP500 earnings the same as 2022 ($218), and 2024 earnings up 10% yoy (history average 7.8% but since we are swinging back from a decline, I will assume double digit here). Inflation stabilized under 4% and continue to decline. Fed schedules 1-2 less cuts by the end of 2023 comparing to what’s anticipated today.

***Bull case (green):*** Assume 2023 SP500 earnings up 10% yoy (to $240 based on last week’s bank earnings results), and 2024 earnings up 10% yoy again (to $264). Inflation stabilized under 4% and continue to decline. Fed scheduled the same number of cuts by the end of 2023 as anticipated today (Dovish).

***Bear case (red):*** Assume we hit a mild recession with 5% earnings decline in 2023 but expect to swing back to $218 in 2024. Inflation well under control, but Fed still schedules 1-2 less cuts by the end of 2023 comparing to what’s anticipated today (hawkish).

Stocks are definitely expensive right now. Light blue box is where we are today. NTM EPS estimate is at $216, but forward PE multiple sits at 19. If we assume history average of forward PE multiple (17), we should be at 3740. The mismatch mostly comes from the crazy valuations of big tech companies (SP500 Company Forward PE ratio below). If they don't beat their earning and guidance estimates big time (i seriously doubt given Samsung and TSM results and Apple mac order slump), it's gonna be sell sell sell!

*Processing img grolrmsxs4ua1...*

**US Treasury Bond (TLT)**

My view on TLT remain the same. Unless inflation is out of control, Fed cuts will be gradually priced into TLT throughout the year. However, recent liquidity injection from the Fed artificially suppressed bond yield (TLT had a small rally).  I think as bank earnings calmed the market, and Fed continue to shrink its balance sheet, recent rally of TLT will not last, and TLT will be under pressure in the short term. I will continue to add while it’s below $104.

12meva5,DD,"The Big Cup and Handle, Earnings, CPI and FOMC…. 4-14-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, 10YR Yield and DXY Weekly Market Analysis","Well after a really nice family vacation at Disney and universal studios Orlando for a week I was extremely excited to get back into the saddle today and do some trading myself. I was still able to call out some great levels over the week while waiting in some lines but nothing better than being back in the office and making some nice gains. 

Going to have a slightly longer post here to catch up on some things that happened while I was gone… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/506xd8m18xta1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9dbc7ad1f1f2113fd57396919a27cc4aee5ccdd7

The first obviously would be CPI… CPI YoY came in bullishly as expected (very few expected anything other than that)…. But what was the true story? The true story was CORE YoY which came in at 5.6% which was 0.1% hotter than previous CORE YoY. 

Here is why CORE is important: By stripping out the volatile components of the CPI, core inflation allows us to see the broad underlying trend in consumer prices. Core inflation is often used as an indicator of the long‐term inflation trend as well as future inflation.

Now take a look at the trend on CPI YoY and CORE YoY for the last year. CPI YoY has been falling since June 2022 consistently… and actually took a 1% drop from month to month which is the largest decrease in YoY CPI since November to December which dropped 0.6%... However, take a look at CORE YoY… CORE has only been falling since September consistently. With this increase from 5.5 to 5.6% on YoY CORE we actually saw our first INCREASE in CORE YoY since September 2022. Now I actually am surprised markets have not reacted more to it than they did already… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/70lj5h228xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38d032932179a5f3642a0f933b9c1476f09b7c5b

Now not surprisingly we went from about a 50/50 chance of a pause to 79.5% chance of a 25bps…. Honestly that’s not really the main story to be talking about here… Lets talk about June 14th FOMC… why does June FOMC matter so much? Well currently there are 6 total FOMC meetings scheduled by the EOY… With 25bps expected at May 3rd… that means there are 5 meetings left… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0y479gl28xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77a7aa9feb7b7803391d95eb03c181dd74fbff0f

Now according to the Atlanta Fed probability tracker by EOY we are expecting to be in a 425 to 450 target range…. Which means when we get our 25bps hike in May that will put the fed funds rate at 500-525…. That means currently market has about 100bps of cuts priced in by EOY…

This assumes the following schedule…

May 3rd= 25bps (500-525)  
 June 14th= Pause  
 July 26th= No bps/ hold   
 Sept 20th= (475-500  
 October 1st= (450-475)  
 December 13th= (425-450)

Now lets look at inflation… IF inflation is about to rebound and when we look at the fact that over the last oil futures are up 30% over the last month… there is a REALLY good chance that CPI is going to rebound. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4l2ltx538xta1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b81f80de0228c59937455fee4c580ac9a43fb9ac

If we get a rebound on CPI there is no way that JPOW would pause… and not only that but or those of you who forgot (and I think markets were kindly reminded Wednesday with FOMC minutes) JPOW mic dropped the markets and said that there was NO base case for rate hikes… one of the only reasons they even considered a pause and didn’t do 50bps was because of the bank run and they were afraid of breaking the market… 

Now JPOW himself and fed officially all agree as of last FOMC (which not much has changed since) that there is NO case for rate CUTS by EOY… Yet the market has priced in about 100BPS of cuts by EOY…

Very quickly here we are going to find out who is right and who is wrong… May FOMC very well may give us some insight into what JPOW is feeling… 

We are scheduled to have a CPI reading on May 10th and June 13th which means between the next two FOMCs we will get two more readings… IF any of these readings show that rebound in inflation then the markets are going to have no choice but to realize they priced this all wrong…

JPOW has to confirm this as the last rate hike (May) or we are likely to see the markets get broken over the summer when they realize the fed funds rate projection is 1000% incorrect and that we are not pausing like they decided (even though JPOW said we weren’t going to…).

Looking at the calendar for next week we have really nothing notable to keep an eye on besides jobless claims Thursday (haven’t moved markets much), Friday is PMI and then a few fed speakers sprinkled throughout. 

This probably explains why Monday DTE SPX IV is currently sitting in the 8% range… I don’t know the last time I have seen IV that low over the weekend. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mad0hy248xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ffbb3d0e6c1f109c5e64934067ba92317157343

This week did add a few new levels but surprisingly we have not taken out any old levels yet… very interesting that there is so much price action happening here in this 409 to 414 area. 

Looking at Daily here we today established a new demand (support) at 409.19 which should provide some upside potential. We actually have officially broken extreme bull momentum this week so we no longer have as strong of an upside case. 

414.13 and 415.36 supplies (resistance) have provided some hefty resistance the last two days and I would look for those levels to continue to reject us. A few things to note about SPY Daily is that volatility is picking up (which can signal an end of a trend (which currently is bull), price action on Wednesday actually signaled a bearish reversal and we lose extreme bull momentum. The only thing really left is for the IV increase on the daily time frame which would be the final confirmation of a bearish reversal pattern. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qo9iqbq48xta1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=847e07bae7fe1910d9fc5ca445e42f353b09300a

Now the last 2 weeks (going into this week) we had see that 410 weekly supply (resistance) hold extremely well, however, we finally did poke over that and close over it this week. With that weekly closure over supply one COULD assume a run to 427.53 supply (resistance) is coming. 

However, the weekly timeframe is still attempting to establish a new supply which now would be a supply over 410 (resistance). 

I see two weekly possibility heres… first is that we turn this weekly candle into supply which means 412.63 becomes a new supply. This would allow for a retrace back under 410 to take out that supply. From there with SPY weekly NOT in extreme bull momentum we would look to 385.9 demand (support) or a new demand being established to potentially bounce us. 

Our second possibility here would be that we continue to push higher and higher and target 427.53 supply that was established back in August of 2022. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7n5f76a58xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=99ae1441e6157c703226120fb3b1b55313970109

On a daily time frame here we have a really beautiful cup and handle still attempting to play out. That upside of the cup could be the 415.1 rejection. If that is indeed the upside of the cup with a 9% low to high rise we would start to look for a 33.33% retrace to form the handle which will result in about a 3% retrace which then gives a possible downside target of 402.6. There is a potential scenario where we do run to 417.03 to form the cup which would give 405.2 as our retrace target. 

We still have our 3 gaps in the 396.5 to 404.55 range that needs to be filled also. 

We continue to bounce off the daily 8ema and continue to rise in this red bull channel. Currently support sits at 411 for Monday for that bull channel. Which means if we break under 411 then we will break this nearly month long support and should start to look for a sell off. 

One other thing to keep an eye on here is that 406.6 to 413.6 continues to be a consolidation area also and we have held that range (at close) for 10 straight trading days. Breaking out of one of these areas is likely to be a signal of direction to come. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g8ew72w58xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b9d483bdaff23cd0045d3de2eba2ffbad5ae661

The weekly chart here is actually a bit more intriguing as there isn’t a good sold answer of what way we are going to go… 

From a bullish stand point we continue to hold the weekly 8ema support and continued to put in a higher high and broke the breakout triangle that dates back over a year now. With that we should fully start looking for a run to 427.25 supply (resistance) that was established back in August. 

However, from a bearish stand point we perfectly double topped at 412.5 resistance that was established back in January 2023. With the long side of the wick to the upside here that could signal a likely top which would bring SPY back down next week. In addition we broke the month long red bull channel support. 

Bears will look to keep 412.5 as resistance and will look to close back under key 407.3 weekly channel support. However, bulls will look to break through 412.5 resistance and target 417 and 422. We actually have a small weekly gap DOWN from 421.22 to 419.96 from August. 

If you remember dating back a year now SPY has at max spent 4 weeks CLOSED over 407.7 and on average only CLOSES 3 weekly candles over 407.3 before it retraces back below. This week marks week 3 of closures over 407.7… 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 410 -> 427.5  
 Demand- 385.9  
 Support- 407.3 -> 404  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 417

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMNAD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9nxkrk68xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47af58266f1b5e5cbd3b82123ffa57f296e265f7

Futures daily here is trying to close out a doji double top here at 4170. Futures has actually bounced off of the daily 8ema 5 out of the last 7 trading days. Futures made a new demand (support) on 4-12 at 4116 which provides the current upside push. 

With Futures no longer being in extreme bull momentum and much like SPY nearing bearish reversal conditions we should continue to look for this to be the top. We are currently trending between 4160 and 4198 supplies. IF and when we establish a new supply our downside targets will remain 4160 -> 4153 and then 4116. 

If bears can take us under 4116 there are still 3 major levels that need to be taken out down at 4055, 4040, and 4015 before Futes can not only push higher but sustain a higher push. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zfd3wt278xta1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdcf6f6546cbca103973c3cdcbe87e0476876761

Futures weekly here shows much of the same as SPY… Showing that we barely today (despite trading under it most of the day) closed over 4149 weekly supply (resistance) and our next upside target remains 4284 is bulls can continue to push us up. However, If we are to turn 4170 into a new weekly supply our downside targets would be 4149 and then 4055.

Bulls still need to go back down and take out weekly supply at 4149 and 4055 before we can realistically push higher in a balanced manner. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yuay69i78xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8441423edb9fd1cb210cccebe39859a8acb0946

You can see the really nice daily double top with the doji here at 4172 on Futures. This is where price action is more or less without trend as we saw much of today an aggressive sell off only to once again by EOD recover. The daily 8ema still remains key support and for the last 2 weeks was an opportunity to buy calls at every touch. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gm6mt288xta1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d5ce2157c2579b08ce30946e5997b751afa6e61

From a very similar stand point here we see that futures broke through the black breakout triangle resistance however it also broke through the 4 week long bull channel support. There we a nice back test of 4095 area that did hold on futures… with a closure over 4149 (unlike spy that double topped here) the upside potential on futures remains a run to 4220. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4149 -> 4284  
 Demand- 3919  
 Support- 4135 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4220

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9atpzvi88xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=011cda9df12dcf328d9be79c91d55faa59cd7468

Now this is where things get a bit interesting… the VIX closed 1 penny higher than the 52 week low of 17.06. 

Something that is interesting about the VIX and anytime it touches the 17s is that usually is the local top on SPY… lets take a look at the times it has hit <$18 and what SPY did afterwards. 

Feb 2nd VIX hit a low of 17.06 (current 52 week low)… SPY the next day dumped -1.06% and that led to the current -9% 26 day drop before a bottom was put in at 380.65.

January 12th the VIX hit a low of 17.36 and the next day SPY dumped -1.38% and this led to a -11% 12 day sell off. 

January 4th the VIX bottomed at 16.34 which led to a -1.92% drop the next day and led to a -5% and 6 day sell off…

On Average the last 3 times the VIX was this low the next day SPY dropped -1.45% and over an average of 14.6 days dropped a total of -8.33%... This would give SPY a target of 380.6 by may 1st… which is almost exactly the next FOMC meeting and almost exactly the low we put in during the march sell off. 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkn4dtva8xta1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=748621cd1844abe94c9a7b414a206bd3e3168fa9

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fazgo1pc8xta1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b554b3a611dd6b1a1b3ee4fa45fe0d750d4e5beb

Now this is something else that interestingly enough on DXY and the 10YR yield that also goes perfectly with the VIX 17.07 bounce (aka calling the bottom of VIX and Top of SPY) and goes with the possible cup and handle being formed on SPY/ futures daily. 

When we look at the last time the officially top of SPY was put in it was on February 2nd and the DXY put in a support level at 100.86 at that time. Yesterday and today the DXY bounced off these level and formed a really nice double bottom off of 100.99. 

Also taking a look at the 10YR yield generally speaking we see the rates of the 10YR rise while SPY drops… with a local bottom potentially being put in at 3.306% support last week… if the 10YR is able to push through 3.518% then our target would be 3.617% to 3.704% on the 10YR…. The last time the 10YR traded at 3.518% SPY was at 408.44 to 411.37. The last time it traded 3.617 to 3.704% SPY was trading at 380.65 to 393.45… 

While I know many people are pretty bullish right now… there are a lot of stars aligning that could provide a drop as low as 380… but more realistically I think a retest of 390 leading into the next FOMC meeting is entirely possible. 

**EARNINGS**

One other thing to keep in mind is that over the next month we are starting to come into Earnings season with banks kicking us off today already. 

Next week we can look forward to more banks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Wednesday we have Tesla. 

Thursday starts us off with TSM, more banks, and some retail starting to trickle in.

The big week for earnings will be the Week of April 24th to April 28th with Meta, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT… with apple the following week. 

Tesla will be the key to watch Wednesday after hours to start off the earning seasons… for those of you who don’t remember… last earnings Tesla ran 33.34% intra-week and went on to run up a total of about 62% over that month. 

**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**

📷

Realistically this says weekly trading log but this is just my intraday trading log as I was gone Monday through Thursday and didn’t take any trades… I did open some 98dte (current) DTE 405p that are down about 20% right now though… 

To clarify here a SCALP for me uses the 1 minute chart primarily for entry with a few different indicators and is playing a bounce or rejection generally off the 1 minute time frame with a shorter expected hold generally holding for the full cycle of the 1min DMI. A Level to Level play for me involves the use of 15min supply and demand, ORB (opening range breakout strategy) with primarily taken entries based off the 5min and 15min candle price action with 1min help for a good entry. 

Was able to hit just over 50% of my WEEKLY goal intraday today… it was a killer morning playing some beautiful scalps that ran aggressively for me. I gave back quite a bit mid day as I still struggle finding good entries and mostly continuation from that noon to 2pm time frame much like the last few weeks of trading. 

Overall a great day of trading and for me I was so excited to get home to start trading I couldn’t be happier with todays results. Looking forward to next week trading. 

I did end up swinging some 3dte (Monday expiration) 4135P due to the fact that IV was so incredibly low (it was almost in the 7% range) when I opened them and the fact that I believe the VIX will recoil Monday with the dollar and 10YR which should provide a downside push on SPY.",DaddyDersch,75,0.91,145,0,3,145,16,2023-04-14T21:51:44Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12meva5/the_big_cup_and_handle_earnings_cpi_and_fomc/

As I mentioned yesterday, 100% chance for a quarter point raises in May. But what matters is whether rates will be higher for longer which I will discuss later. 

U Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations spiked to 4.6% indicating price volatility likely to continue. Probably due to recent rise in gas price or egg price. Bad news for inflation.

 **The Business**

Stellar earnings report from big banks eased the fear of a banking crisis and pushing financial sector up 0.7%.

JP Morgan beat 1Q23 expectations by about 20%-25% due to higher NII, which is now guided almost 10% higher for 2023 even while expense guidance is unchanged. I guess one man’s loss is another man’s gain.

Interestingly, rest of the market didn’t join the celebration, are we turning into the “good news is bad news (inflation is here to stay) and bad news is also bad news (earnings are fucked)” mind set? One can only dream.

On other news, as always, Boeing casually dropped the ball on 737MAX delivery.

**The Economy**

US economy activity is still robust.

There has been a series of upward adjustment to the GDPNow model, which is now up to +2.5% (q/q ann.) for 1Q23. Consumption, business investment, government spending, and net exports contributing to growth while housing and inventories subtracting

But more deflation force is taking the helm from overseas. 

South Korean Export prices now falling 6% Y/Y. Largest decline since August 2020. Manufacturing products fell -6.4% vs. -2.6% Y/Y previously. Canary in the coal mine.

Same trend with US Import Price Index. MoM Mar: -0.6% (est -0.1%; prev -0.1%), yoy -4.6% versus -1.0% last month. That is the largest YoY decline since the index fell -6.3% in May 2020

More deflation news on housing too. Redfin data confirmed rent might have peaked, same as the data from Apartment.com (see my post from Wednesday).

March retail sales weaker at -1% m/m vs. -0.5% est. & -0.2% prior. This is in line with the BoA data (see my post from Wednesday) which showed credit card spending on retail declined YOY but spending on service increased. However, once you take out auto&gas, the number actually surprised to the upside.

**So, where we are at in the battle against inflation?** Let’s break it down from both supply side and demand side.

From ISM manufacturing, shipping cost (see my post from Monday) to import prices, supply side inflation is in full retreat. This is great news for overall inflation.

However, things are not so pretty on the demand side. Wages are still growing, goods are cheaper and rent is at a turning point (less burden for consumers). So far this year, consumers are still much better off than they were before the pandemic in terms of savings (more) and debt (less) (see my post from Wednesday). Job market is still very tight. All of these will continue to create space for strong consumer spending, so the demand side of inflation is still sticky at this point. 

Putting these all together, the combination is great for business as margin will expand. We might see earnings revisions to the upper side further into the year (good for stocks). For Fed, this is good too, they are very limited in controlling the supply side inflation but crushing the demand side is their bread and butter. With the support of low jobless rate and sticky inflation numbers, higher rate for longer is more likely now (bad for stocks). 

Overall, my SP500 year-end view has not changed. $220 earnings and 17-19X PE multiple (3740-4180) is still my base case. This might change after more earnings result this month.

THEY ARE PROCEEDING WITH A SETTLEMENT, BUT THE TIMING AND HOW IT IMPACTS WHEN THE STATUS QUO ORDER WILL BE LIFTED IS UNCERTAIN. I WOULD NOT ASSUME SO QUICK THAT THE ORDER WILL BE LIFTED BEFORE THE END OF JUNE WHEN A SETTLEMENT HEARING AND FINAL RULING MAY TAKE PLACE. - AS ALWAYS DO YOU OWN DD AND BE SMART INVESTING.**

For those of you with short or put positions in AMC sharing my thoughts on the lawsuit and what I think the outcome may be.

(this is going to be long and dry... only read if seriously interested in this and want to piggyback of my research or thoughts here)

Some brief background:

1. AMC needs to raise funds to help pay down debt and after various prior attempts at increasing the authorized shares of AMC that failed they decided to create APE (Preferred Equity Units) to be able to sell to raise funds.
2. APE shares effectively have the same equity and voting rights as AMC shares and if at any such time the authorized shares of AMC were sufficient to allow conversion of the APE shares, the APE shares would convert and become AMC shares (on a 1:1 ratio).
3. APE shares were initially issued as a stock dividend where for each share of AMC owned you received 1 share of APE.
4. Subsequently the company engaged in the sale of further APE shares to the public however that resulted in the share price of APE dropping very low (currently APE trades at a significant discount to AMC).
5. Eventually the company entered into a deal with Antara where they sold them a number of shares of APE in exchange for a promise to hold a vote to increase the authorized shares of AMC allowing for conversion (with enough shares left over to allow AMC to attempt to raise funds).
6. The vote was scheduled for mid-March with a provision that APE and AMC shares would vote together as one class and further broker non-votes for APE would be voted proportionally to the shares voted. - This vote also included a reverse split, but that is irrelevant for this discussion as it relates solely to technical listing requirements.
7. In February, Allegeheny County Employees Retirement System initiated a class action lawsuit attempting to stop the vote and prevent the increase in the authorized shares of AMC and accordingly prevent APE from being converted to AMC. They asked for a temporary restraining order pending resolution of the case.
8. Shortly after the court and the parties agreed to a ""status quo order"" pending a decision on the hearing on the temporary restraining order (TRO), scheduled for 4/27/2023. The status quo order allowed the vote to go through but required keeping track of votes by class. The order also prevented the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.
9. The two parties then attempted to enter into a settlement agreement where AMC shareholders were to get 1 additional share per every 7.5 shares owned and in exchange the status quo order would be lifted.
10. The court denied entering the settlement prior to a hearing in order to ensure rights of the parties were protected.

While there are many more details I think the above summarizes sufficiently the key events here to where we are now. Currently we are waiting for the 4/27 hearing on the TRO which may determine when conversion can occur. After spending some time analyzing the case and the law I think the following outcome is likely:

1. It does not seem logical for a new status quo order to be issued after the TRO hearing as they are essentially the same thing. If the court does not believe a TRO is warranted then issuing another status quo should also not be warranted. If the court believes restraining action is warranted then they should issue a TRO and not a status quo order. So to start with, I think we either have a TRO or not and it is unlikely to see another status quo order here.
2. In order to get an TRO, you have to show sufficient merit to your case. The class action essentially argues a few points.

* Going against shareholder wishes
* and Breach of Sec 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, making the issuance of APE defective and requiring corrective action under Sec 204.

Regarding going against shareholder wishes... Well the company did have the vote and the AMC shareholders that voted, voted over 70% in favor of conversion. I think that conclusively shows that shareholder wishes were not violated and any claims about breach of fiduciary duty here should be assumed to fail.

As to Sec 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (relating to class voting)... It seems if your Charter opts out of this section it is not binding. If you read the Cert. of Ins. it says that this section is opted out of. Instead the class action relies on recasting the whole series of events as an attempt to improperly undermine AMC shareholder rights which they argue should require class voting regardless of the Cert of Inc. As already noted, the vote being in-favor of conversion here shows much of this argument is weak as the actions were supported by the AMC shareholders.

Further it seems DE courts take a very narrow view here what it means by shareholder rights. Creating new classes of stock (assuming the Cert of Inc allows it) with all sorts of rights is not the same as altering rights of existing classes of shares. This is why the class action spends extensive effort on characterizing the whole series of actions as UNDERMINING the class A voting rights. They are trying to argue that rights were effectively altered, which seems a stretch period.

In any case it would seem (based on my weak legal background) that to show a violation of the law you need to make the case that some fiduciary duty here was violated (but the actual vote shows otherwise) and that somehow should cause a violation of Sec 242(b)(2) which otherwise should not apply due to the Cert of Inc opting out of that. Basically, it does not seem likely any law was actually violated here.

Some other people may point to a requirement for the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders to amend the cert of ins as an issue here. However a review of the details should indicate this is not an issue.

1. At the record date there were 1.447 billion shares outstanding. 766 million voted, which is over 50%, meaning quorum was met.
2. 663 million voted yes, which is 61 million under 50% of the total shares outstanding giving rise to the claim that an affirmative majority was not met... however...
3. The APE registration documents specifies that in any matter voted on, ""non-votes"" will be voted by the depository (i.e. Computershare) proportionally to the shares voted. Accordingly when those votes are added you easily have a majority of shares affirmatively voting yes.

In addition for a TRO to be issued there has to be some harm that cannot be rectified. It would seem that is a weak consideration as well as the company can issue bonus shares to the class to compensate them for any loss in voting rights here. As to loss in value... Well to the extent that loss arises due to market conditions that is not the courts domain in any case. Rather the court is limited to focusing on equity and voting rights in the company here and not what the stock price trades at.

There is also a question as to balance of equities. Any TRO here would constrain the company from raising funds and potentially risk bankruptcy. On the other hand allowing the action to go through could always be rectified with bonus shares.

In conclusion... I think likely that on 4/27 the Judge will find that the requirements for a TRO here are not met and accordingly will not issue a TRO and the status quo order will lapse allowing conversion to go through.

What I don't know is exactly which date the judge will issue the ruling or how many days it takes to convert the stock after. AFAIK, all NYSE requirements are met already so this should just be an issue between AMC and Computershare processing it.

Positions: Loads of Puts going out over the next half year or so.

Edit - Subsequent to this post I saw the lawyers wrote a letter to the judge asking to hold a status conference next week to discuss timing and notice for presentation of the proposed settlement. They ask adjournment of the deadlines previously determined 3/2/2023 (which includes that 4/27/2023 TRO hearing date) pending the court's full review and decision whether to approve the proposed settlement. - Not sure what this means for the timeline now or how it impacts the status quo order (i.e. does the court lift the status quo before the settlement... is Allegheny even still seeking a TRO?)",aka0007,41,0.86,45,0,0,45,0,2023-04-14T17:56:15Z,Edited,False,t2_y2jcr,31,7641,21,4201,2016-05-20T08:48:02Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12m5xyq/amc_class_action_lawsuit_analysis/

12lu1gu,DD,The New UBS : An Economy Of Scale,"**An Analysis Of The Merger between UBS & Credit Suisse.**

*""It would have significant implications for the financial industry, as both are major players in the global banking sector.""*

A merger between Credit Suisse and UBS would create a larger entity with greater economies of scale. Economies of scale refer to the cost savings that a company can achieve by increasing its size or output, which can result in increased efficiency and profitability.

One potential benefit of the merger would be increased market share and greater economies of scale, which could lead to increased efficiency and profitability for the merged entity. Additionally, the merger could help to consolidate the Swiss banking sector, which has been under pressure from increased regulatory scrutiny and competition from international banks.

**The Coming Recession & Wealth Management**

Wealth management services can often fare well during recessions for several reasons.

Firstly, during recessions, investors tend to become more risk-averse and seek out more conservative investment options. Wealth management firms are well-positioned to provide these types of investment options, such as bonds and other fixed-income securities, to their clients.

Secondly, during recessions, many investors may need to rebalance their portfolios to reflect changing market conditions. Wealth management firms can provide guidance and support to clients as they navigate these changes, which can help to maintain their overall financial stability.

Thirdly, wealth management firms often offer a range of financial planning and advisory services that can be especially valuable during economic downturns. For example, they may help clients to manage debt, reduce expenses, and build emergency funds to weather the storm of a recession.

**Merging A Monster?**

If Credit Suisse and UBS were to merge, the wealth management services offered by the merged institution could be well-positioned to weather a recession for several reasons.

For starters, the merged institution would likely have a larger and more diverse pool of assets under management, upwards of **5 trillion dollars!** This is according to the UBS website, which could actually help to reduce the overall impact of market volatility on its clients' portfolios. Additionally, the institution could potentially leverage its expanded resources to offer a wider range of investment options and financial planning services to its clients.

Secondly, the merged institution could benefit from economies of scale and cost savings, which could help it to manage expenses and maintain profitability even in challenging economic conditions.

Thirdly, the merged institution could potentially benefit from increased brand recognition and reputation, which could attract new clients even during a recession. This could help to offset any potential outflows from existing clients who may need to withdraw funds during difficult economic times.

**A ""Sticky"" Situation**

However, there are also potential drawbacks to the merger. The integration process could be complicated and costly, and there may be cultural differences and redundancies that need to be addressed. Furthermore, there may be concerns about antitrust issues, as the merged entity could become too dominant in certain markets.

**A Hero Crisis Manager**

Colm Kelleher is a former executive of the financial services company, Morgan Stanley. He was born in Ireland in 1957 and graduated from University College Dublin with a degree in philosophy and history. Kelleher started his career in finance in London in the early 1980s before moving to the United States in 1986 to work for Morgan Stanley.

During his time at Morgan Stanley, Colm Kelleher played a key role in managing the firm through several financial crises. In particular, he was instrumental in leading the firm's response to the 2008 financial crisis.

As the head of the firm's institutional securities group, Kelleher was responsible for overseeing Morgan Stanley's sales and trading operations, as well as its investment banking division. During the crisis, he helped to restructure the firm's businesses, cut costs, and shift the focus of the firm's operations to more stable sources of revenue. He also played a key role in negotiating with regulators and other financial institutions to stabilize the broader financial system.

Kelleher was widely credited with helping to steer Morgan Stanley through the crisis and positioning the firm for future success. In recognition of his leadership during this time, he was named one of the ""25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis"" by Time magazine, which noted that he ""played a key role in steering Morgan Stanley through the treacherous waters of the financial crisis.""

**The Technicals**

As we have already discussed, if Credit Suisse and UBS were to merge, the wealth management services offered by the merged institution could be well-positioned to weather a recession. With the Federal Reserve's persistence in hiking rates, and the ""most anticipated recession of our century"" as current market sentiment would put it, This seems like a likely scenario. But, What does technical analysis say about UBS?

&#x200B;

[TA of UBS with confirmation of trendline support by: Me](https://preview.redd.it/3igfk0yn4uta1.jpg?width=1012&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9dfd38704b55d3c784b0b779c50f467c6ddaeedd)

First, we start by identifying the pattern, which is a downward slope. In technical analysis, a downward slope refers to a pattern on a chart where the price of a security is consistently declining over time. This pattern is also known as a downtrend or bearish trend.

A downward slope can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a weakening economy, negative news about the company or industry, or changes in investor sentiment. Typically, a downward slope plays out in a series of lower highs and lower lows, as sellers dominate the market and push prices lower.

If there is a breakout above the trendline for a downward slope, a retest of the trendline could potentially confirm the signal if there is a positive rejection. A retest occurs when the price of the security falls back to the trendline after a breakout, and a positive rejection happens when the price bounces off the trendline and continues to move in the direction of the breakout. A retest can help to confirm that the trendline is now acting as a level of support, rather than resistance, and that traders are continuing to buy the security at higher prices. This is exactly what we see in the UBS chart.

If the retest is successful and the positive rejection is confirmed, traders may interpret it as a strong signal to enter long positions, and to manage their risk with a stop-loss order below the trendline. However, if the retest fails and the price falls below the trendline, it could indicate that the breakout was false and that the bearish trend is likely to continue.  Overall, the potential impact of a Credit Suisse and UBS merger would depend on the specifics of the deal, including the terms of the merger, the regulatory environment, and the broader economic and geopolitical landscape. It's also important to note that any merger or acquisition involves significant risks and uncertainties, and there is no guarantee of success.",Allah2Allah,21,0.62,3,0,0,3,1,2023-04-14T11:26:43Z,False,False,t2_7gwxyuop,30,97,7,49,2021-01-30T15:00:45Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12lu1gu/the_new_ubs_an_economy_of_scale/

## Trading Thesis - Elementary, My Dear Watson: Why Crayon Flavors Matter 🖍🤔

Hark! Technical analysis and indicator-based alchemy 🔮 oft rely on historical prices to predict crucial values today. Behold this thesis, crafted with care, observing the present option open interest.

Through such means, we calculate those curious greeks – Delta and Gamma, mind you – for the entire portfolio. Then, simulating changes in these metrics at various price points, we unveil price levels where the all-encompassing gamma reaches its peak, and delta comes perilously close to naught.

Indeed, certain tickers show tremendous response from the fabled delta neutral, gamma max, or perchance, both. The reactions from these price points of yore propel our trading signals into the unknown 🕵️‍♂️.

Thus, our plays and entry prices materialize from the binomial option pricing model, reflecting expectations of the size and duration of the effect from gamma max or delta neutral. Many profit from shifts in the stock itself. But the crème de la crème impacts not only the direction but the increase in IV, as well 💰.

12l8988,DD,"Market Recap 4/13/2023 - PPI lower than expected, money printers go brrr","**The Fed**

By the end of market close yield curve flattened a bit comparing to that of yesterday. Market is encouraged by the PPI decline (not slow down but actual decline MoM). Jobs came in basically in line with expectation. The US job market is still very tight. Overall, yield barely changed and Fed May hike probability is still at 66%. I personally think it’s a 100%, given CPI still higher than rate, and jobless claim still much lower than Fed target of 4.5%, but it won’t affect stock price anymore at this point.

**The Business**

No update today. Outlook still the same as of yesterday. Only difference is today’s PPI data indicate Q1 company margin might be better than expect (PPI dropped faster than CPI) and down the road (if the trend continues) which is bullish for earnings and stocks. Bank earnings tomorrow will be important to watch as market reaction will set the tone for the season.

**The Economy**

Global liquidity on the rise since last Oct which supported the equity rally. While Fed is still tightening (barely), the rest of the world had turned on the printing machine already.

China might be the biggest printer going forward which we should keep an eye on as their credit impulse leads US PMI about 3-6 month. And it’s been on the run lately which means US PMI might be bottoming in the next few months.

12kzvl1,DD,Cheap (South) American Oil! Geopark ($GPRK),"If you are bullish about the ENERGY sector this year, it seems a good pick (but only if you are not scared of a little bit leftist government in South America) and here's why:

According to GEOPARK data, 95% of its operation is cash flow positive with a brent price above 30 USD and the expected brent price for this year is betwenn 80 a 90 USD.

It's current PE is around 3. Since 2019 it had been profitable (if we skip the COVID part) and the average PE for that period, excluding the COVID year, has been 9,76.

If we take a look at the stock price since the election of PETRO, it took a 39% fall in only 44 days (seems like an overshooting for me). The brent peak price was around the time that PETRO got elected. The declining oil price had something to do with the stock beating, but some people may put all the guilt into PETRO's leftist policies (which I haven't seen any dangerous one yet).

I believe there is a lot of upside (it may take some time) in some of the left-run countries in South America like brazilian, chilean and colombian ADR's and this is one of them. I have my reasons and I swear to God that I am only interested in making money and spread my political agenda. I also believe that the SPY is still overpriced and it is a good time to look elsewhere.

I am not an energy specialist nor a succesful investor (yet). I just took a look at the income statement, the stock charts and the company's last quarter presentation. 

This is my first post, I am not a native english speaker and, to be honest, I dream of being a rich wallstreet degenerate someday!

Thanks for reading and if you share some feedback, it would be great.

I am also a big fan of Benjamin's Youtube Channel.

12kvaap,DD,Your play for UHN Earnings Tomorrow,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is among a group of firms set to report earnings later this week, along with several financial stocks like BlackRock (BLK), Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC). UNH stock has been in rally mode, helped by some Medicare news earlier in the week, along with an analyst upgrade last week. We're going to focus on UNH, reporting [tomorrow morning.](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/unh)

Financial stocks are still badly lagging the market after the failure of SVB Financial and Signature Bank. The broad-based weakness in the financial sector has put concerns about the health of the economy back on the front burner. Morgan Stanley on Wednesday said that Wall Street estimates for regional banks need to come down meaningfully as Q1 earnings season gets underway.

At the end of March, the FactSet estimate earnings decline for the S&P 500 was -6.6%. That would mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since the second quarter of 2020.

**What about UnitedHealth Group?**

UNH stock gapped above its 50-day moving average last week, helped by news that Medicare finalized payment rates for 2024 that were much higher than expected. Shares jumped again on the 5th after Raymond James upgraded the managed care firm to strong buy from outperform. The stock is also testing resistance at the 200-day moving average.

For a megacap stock, UnitedHealth continues to deliver impressive quarterly and annual earnings growth. Top-line growth has also been solid, ranging from 11% to 15% over the past seven quarters. UNH stock reversed lower in heavy volume when the company reported Q4 results on Jan. 13. Adjusted profit increased 19% to $5.34 a share, 17 cents ahead of views. Revenue rose 12% to $82.8 billion, just ahead of the $82.6 billion consensus. Total membership increased 375,000 from the prior quarter. The company added 165,000 Medicaid members, 130,000 commercial members and 70,000 Medicare Advantage members. UnitedHealth's Optum Health services unit continues to be a growth driver amid the expansion of Optum's value-based care delivery initiatives.

It's also important to note that UnitedHealth Group's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 20.58. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.49, so we one might conclude that UnitedHealth Group is trading at a premium comparatively. We can also consider that UNH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.44. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Medical - HMOs stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.94 based on yesterday's closing prices. 

For the current quarter, the estimate is for adjusted profit of $6.25 a share, up 14% year over year. Revenue is expected to climb 12% to $89.4 billion. Oh boy - results are due Friday before the open along with BlackRock, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.

Loan loss provisions will be a focal point for banks again with worries about a sharp slowdown for the economy on the front burner again. Banks tend to set more money aside during a slowdown to account for rising loan defaults.

**So what to do for Earnings?**

I'm going to go for a slightly in-the-money weekly call option with a 525 strike price (April 21 expiration) at a premium of around $8.70 per contract, or about 1.6% of the underlying stock price at the time of writing this. To break it down for the noobies, one contract will give me -the holder- the right to buy 100 shares of UNH stock at 525 per share. The most that can be lost is $870 — the amount I'm paying for the 100-share contract.",CalmGains,7,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,2023-04-13T16:46:47Z,False,False,t2_8vyhj5k4g,15,304,10,106,2023-04-09T17:30:16Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12kvaap/your_play_for_uhn_earnings_tomorrow/
12kt670,DD,Huge value / turnaround play: $PBI,"Fellow regarded degenerates, I have stumbled across something interesting. It's risky, but that's why we're here. The investment group that Ryan Cohen partnered with to take over gaym stonk is actively working on taking over another business.

*The company*

You know how when you buy something on ebay or etsy the tracking info always says the package is being sent from Pitney Bowes? That's it. That's the company. Pitney Bowes is a shipping and mailing company that's been around for a long time. They work with ebay sellers, etsy sellers, small businesses, most of the fortune 100 companies, government offices, etc to help with shipping logistics. They do not compete directly with UPS or FedEx. In fact, their last mile delivery is handled by the USPS. They mostly deal with shipping headaches. Want to ship a package internationally but don't know how to handle customs? They'll handle it for you. Need to ship lithium batteries or hazardous materials between office locations? They'll make sure it's handled correctly. Want to mail an advertisement to everyone in the state of Georgia? They'll presort it by zip code so the post office charges less. Seriously, 90% of Fortune 100 companies use Pitney Bowes. 

Interestingly, PBI is starting from a stronger position than the video game store did. PBI is actually a profitable company - they just aren't making as much money as they used to be, and they should be making a lot more money than they are.

*The Takeover*

Hestia - the investment group Ryan Cohen worked with to take over the vidya game store - believes Pitney Bowes management sucks, and PBI would be better off with stronger leadership. Hestia started out trying to play nice, but it hasn't gone well so they've staged a proxy fight to try and get their own leadership onto the board of Pitney Bowes. You can see Hestia's presentation here. It has interesting stuff. The proposed business model is straightforward, there's the usual debt restructuring, basic stuff ... and then we get to ""Hey, maybe with less crony capitalism you would make better decisions"". They're particularly pissed that the CEO has nominated personal friends to join the board. Hestia is proposing putting qualified people on the board instead, and they include bios for their nominees.
https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20230412005354/en/1761740/1/Hestia_Capital_Investor_Presentation_Transform_Pitney_Bowes.pdf?download=1 

There's also a website dedicated to the effort. Hestia is using this to educate investors on the takeover attempt. They have a whole business plan, turnaround strategy, the works: https://www.transformpitneybowes.com/ 

*Short Interest*

So, I mentioned gaym stonk a couple of times. That's to highlight that this group is serious and has a history of success. However, this is not the same situation. About 6.59% of PBI shares are held short, which is not a high level of short interest. However, volume is so low that at current trading levels it would take 18 days to cover. This means an upward catalyst could cause extra buying pressure, but there will not be a short squeeze. This is purely a value play. 

*Ways To Play*

If you want a short term play, May 9th is the date. That is the annual meeting, and is when the proxy vote is held. Assuming Hestia succeeds, expect a 20 - 30% pop shortly after the shareholder meeting. This will be the market pricing in the turnaround. I'm playing this with 05/19 $3 calls, because there is extremely little IV priced in. If you like gambling, the 05/19 $4 calls are a little more risky but they would be a double bagger on a 20% pop and a 5x on a 30% pop. 

If you want a long term play, Hestia has a $15/share price target on PBI. Wanna be boring? Buy shares and wait 2 years. Want leverage? I'm playing this with a mix of 01/19/2024 LEAP calls with a mix of strikes at $4 and $5. The 01/19/2024 LEAPs with a $7 strike are also tempting just because they're cheap as hell, but it might take longer than 8 months to see results from the turnaround. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hestia-announces-pitney-bowes-interim-120229278.html

If you want a sure thing, mark May 9th on your calendar. If Hestia wins the proxy vote, buy into the rally. You would miss out on some gains, but it's not like the stock is going straight to $15. There'll be plenty of time to buy. 

*Positions*

I have a bunch of calls. I have ITM calls for 05/19 (hoping to cash in on a pop after the annual meeting), and OTM calls for Jan 2024.

*What are you doing, step-Ryan-Cohen?*

I'll just leave this here.

12ka0d3,DD,$TSLA to 12 trillion AI DD inside,"ChatGPT said so:

TLDR: As of September 2021, Tesla's market cap was around $750 billion, and Apple's (highest market cap in the world) was around $2.4 trillion, making Tesla's market cap about 31.25% of Apple's. Around late 2007 or early 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately 31% of Exxon Mobil's (highest market cap in the world - at that time). Apple's market cap has grown by an estimated 1,500% since 2007. If Tesla's market cap were to grow by the same percentage, its future market cap would hypothetically **be around $12 trillion.** 

 Q: What's the most recent stock price data you have?

A: As an AI language model, I don't have real-time data access or any data beyond September 2021. To obtain the most recent stock price information, please refer to financial news websites, brokerage platforms, or financial market data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg.

Q: As of your most recent data: 1) what is the market cap of tesla?  2) What is the market cap of tesla as a ratio compared to aapl's market cap?

A: As of my most recent data in September 2021:

1. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) had a market capitalization of around $700 billion - $800 billion. Please note that this figure may have changed significantly since then. To get the current market cap, please check a reliable financial data source.
2. Apple Inc. (AAPL) had a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion in September 2021. To calculate the ratio of Tesla's market cap to Apple's market cap at that time, you would divide Tesla's market cap by Apple's market cap. Using the approximate numbers provided:

(Tesla's market cap) / (Apple's market cap) = ($700 - $800 billion) / ($2.4 trillion)

Keep in mind that these figures are outdated and the ratio could be very different now. To get the most recent market cap data and ratio, please refer to an up-to-date financial data source.

Q: what does ($700 - $800 billion) / ($2.4 trillion) equal?

A: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. To clarify, Tesla's market capitalization was between $700 billion and $800 billion, while Apple's was around $2.4 trillion. To find the approximate ratio, we can use the average of Tesla's market cap range:

($700 billion + $800 billion) / 2 = $750 billion

Now, we can calculate the ratio:

(Tesla's market cap) / (Apple's market cap) = ($750 billion) / ($2.4 trillion)

Since 1 trillion equals 1,000 billion, we can convert Apple's market cap to billions:

($750 billion) / (2,400 billion) ≈ 0.3125

So, the ratio of Tesla's market cap to Apple's market cap was approximately 0.3125 or 31.25% based on the data from September 2021. Please note that these figures are outdated, and the ratio could be very different now. To get the most recent market cap data and ratio, please refer to an up-to-date financial data source.

Q: using historical data, 1) when was aapl's market cap ratio 31% compared to the most highest market cap company at that time?  2) what year and prices were they

A: It's challenging to pinpoint the exact date and price when Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) market cap was 31% of the highest market cap company at the time without access to an extensive historical database. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on available information.

In the mid-to-late 2000s, Exxon Mobil (XOM) was often the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. Around the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately $150-$160 billion, while Exxon Mobil's market cap was around $500 billion.

Using these approximate values, we can calculate the ratio:

(Apple's market cap) / (Exxon Mobil's market cap) = ($150-$160 billion) / ($500 billion) ≈ 0.30-0.32 or 30-32%

This suggests that Apple's market cap ratio was roughly 31% compared to Exxon Mobil in late 2007 or early 2008. Note that these are rough estimates, and the actual ratio may have varied slightly. Also, the share prices and market cap values might have been different on the exact day the ratio was 31%. For more accurate historical data, I recommend consulting financial databases or historical stock market records.

Q: what percentage gain in market cap has aapl experienced since 2007 compared to it's value in your most recent data?  What would TSLA's market cap be if it grew from it's present 750 billion market by that same % of growth in the future?

A: As of my most recent data in September 2021, Apple Inc. (AAPL) had a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion. To provide an estimate of the percentage gain in market cap since 2007, let's use the approximate market cap of $150 billion from the end of 2007 as the starting point.

Percentage gain = ((Current market cap - Market cap in 2007) / Market cap in 2007) \* 100

Percentage gain ≈ (($2,400 billion - $150 billion) / $150 billion) \* 100 ≈ 1,500%

Now, let's use the average Tesla Inc. (TSLA) market cap value of $750 billion from my previous response and calculate what its market cap would be if it experienced the same percentage growth as AAPL:

Future market cap = Current market cap \* (1 + (Percentage gain / 100))

Future market cap = $750 billion \* (1 + (1,500% / 100)) = $750 billion \* (1 + 15) = $750 billion \* 16 ≈ $12,000 billion or $12 trillion

If Tesla's market cap were to grow by the same 1,500% as Apple's did from 2007 to September 2021, its market cap would be approximately $12 trillion. Please note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and there's no guarantee that Tesla or any other company will experience the same growth rate as Apple.

12k492l,DD,April 13 2023 volume moving tickers,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",Badboyardie,8,0.77,5,0,0,5,0,2023-04-12T23:45:35Z,False,False,t2_24hau26v,667,2051,162,473,2019-02-15T23:52:47Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12k492l/april_13_2023_volume_moving_tickers/
12jyjoh,DD,Market Recap 4/12/2023 - CPI slightly lower than expected but more jobs to be done by the Fed,"**The Fed**

*TLDR, inflation is going down on the right path but still works to be from the Fed. The bond yields (especially short term bonds) unrealistically priced in too many cuts therefore facing upside risk (yields will go up)*

CPI came in slightly below expectation, however core CPI is still sticky

Price changes over last year: Transportation: +13.9% Electricity: +10.2% Food away from home: +8.8% Food at home: +8.4% Shelter: +8.2% New Cars: +6.1% Gas Utilities: +5.5% Overall CPI: +5.0% Medical Care: +1.0% Used Cars: -11.2% Fuel Oil: -14.2% Gasoline: -17.4%

Shelter is the biggest contributor to core CPI

MoM Shelter rose just 0.66% in March, down from 0.79% in Feb and the lowest since November 22

MoM Rent rose just 0.45% in March, down from 0.71% in Feb and the lowest since March 22

[Shelter contribute 60&#37; of core](https://preview.redd.it/2t4mro6eiita1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bcc0ec278d62c2582b67dc2bda2efea233b404c)

Shelter CPI is a also a very lagging indicator (6 month moving average) whereas real time rent data I showed on Monday is pointing to a much slower growth

The Fed's new favorite inflation indicator - so-called 'Super-Core': Core Services Ex-Shelter - slowed to 5.73% YoY, still quite high

And a reminder that Fed rate (4.75-5%) is still lower than inflation

In comparison, Bank of Canada’s hiking stopped after inflation dropped below 4% (for the second time) and still no cutting (today’s announcement unchanged at 4.5%).

Fed speakers

Fed’s Barkin: We are certainly past peak inflation, still a way to go 

Fed’s Daly:  More Hikes May Not Be Needed to Slow Inflation

But this is what the market is anticipating... To be fair, short term rates are down dramatically not because the market is expecting the Fed to cut, but rather it was caused by recent large inflow of fund into the money market (thanks to SVB) which artificially suppressed short term bond yield

**The Business**

*TLDR, corporate earning facing pressure. Analysts has been slashing 2023 EPS guidance since last year, Q1 earnings results so far has been gloomy.*

BoA – “Clients sold US equities of all sizes last week, pulling roughly $2.3B. Selling was pronounced among institutional, retail, & hedge funds clients. Communication Services & Staples were the only 2 sectors to see inflows. Positioning extremely light”

https://preview.redd.it/do3eukhkjita1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=377901c02372b3039be2437d21315d6e9c74f891

U.S. Equity Strategy: Wells Fargo expects the SP500 to correct by 10% from current levels over the next 3-6 months

Per Factset (from last week on April 6th): the first quarter has seen the highest number of S&P 500 companies issuing negative EPS guidance for a quarter since Q3 2019 (81). If 78 is the final number for the quarter, it will mark the fourth-highest number of companies in the S&P 500 issuing negative EPS guidance for a quarter since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2006. On the other hand, the first quarter has also seen the lowest number of S&P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance for a quarter since Q2 2020

FOMC minutes: ""Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years""

So far earnings estimations are flat to last year but has been on a downward trend; earnings next year is estimated to be way higher at 13% increase from this year, however economists from BoC and IMF both predicting only a 1.4% economy growth this year and 1.3% growth next year.

As of today, SP500 gained exactly 0% for the past 2 years. If you made money in the past 2 years, congratulations, you have beat the market.

&#x200B;

**The Economy**

*TLDR, Consumers are doing OK now but soon to be tapped out. Risk of more spending cuts down the road.*

https://preview.redd.it/01tm3intjita1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55df5c158be12bafbe638ae7f5b9c7f9005c54ec

Card spending basically unchanged yoy however heavily towards service over retail

Credit card utilization rate is still low comparing to 2019; the consumers are doing OK

https://preview.redd.it/sqpktuxyjita1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c3ae38a419ae7d10848cb76c3d1981c849c3089

However, wage growth is way lower than inflation, in fact we have negative real wage (inflation adjusted) growth since 2021. So, something is going to be cut out of the budget. Retail already cut; service next. 

https://preview.redd.it/353f3o32kita1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36c8c567f7a0bedb334532cacf20cf699b34e304

On the other hand, mortgage application up 7.8% last week; up 5 out of the past 6 weeks

&#x200B;

**My year end SP500 estimation (not changed):**

Base case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is stickier than expected, not Fed cut by year-end.

Bull case: earnings close to current estimation, however, inflation is down without large job loss; Fed hint cutting in 2024.

Bear case: earnings come in lower than expectation, however, inflation is still sticky, no Fed cut by year-end.

https://preview.redd.it/fpc38ho6kita1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6b0cc58d7390ffc69549599d7438e767750b3eb1

At today’s level, the market is at the high end of my bull case where earnings remain flat yoy and Fed will cut before the year end. At this point, I think upside profit is much lower than downside risk.

12juh8u,DD,Can Delta or United Airlines Stock Takeoff Tomorrow?,"Looking for a juicy earning play? Consider the airline industry in the post-pandemic era. These companies will emerge this earnings season, and Delta Air Lines (DAL) or United Airlines (UAL) will be at the forefront. Delta and United are expected to report their fiscal first-quarter earnings on April 13 and 18 respectively. In this post, I'm gonna tell you guys why I believe *DAL calls* are the right play for tomorrow. 

Let’s see what’s in store for these airliners as they release their Q1 reports going into a somewhat Covid-19 free peak travel season.

**Q1 Preview**

The estimate for Delta’s Q1 earnings is $0.31 per share compared to *-$1.23 in the prior-year quarter*. Sales are expected to be up 36% at $12.77 billion Vs. $9.35 billion in Q1 2022. This is certainly an indication that Delta is recovering from the pandemic.  

**Performance & Valuation**

Year to date, Delta stock is up +17% to top United and the Transportation-Airline Markets +5% performances while also beating the S&P 500’s +7%. Even better, over the last three years and throughout the pandemic, DAL stock is up +48%. Better still, Delta stocks still trade attractively relative to their past from a price-to-earnings perspective. Trading around $44 per share, DAL has a forward P/E of 5.1x forward earnings. Consider how this is nicely under the industry average of 11.3x. Furthermore, Delta stock trades 78% below its decade-long high of 30.6x and at a 29% discount to the median of 9.2x. 

**Growth & Outlook**

With Delta's valuation at a very attractive point at the moment, monitoring their growth will be important in determining if the stock is indeed undervalued. Delta’s earnings are forecasted to climb 61% this year at $5.17 per share compared to EPS of $3.20 in 2022. Plus, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to leap another 32% to $6.84 per share. On the top line, Delta’s sales are expected to be up 9% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $57.16 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be a 21% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $47 billion.

**Takeaway**

Delta is undervalued and so is United Airlines at the moment. Q1 earnings will be a major pivot point for both stocks, but for tomorrow's ER, I think DAL 4/21 34.5c @ 0.87 offers a pretty decent lotto play if you want in.",CalmGains,24,0.84,21,0,0,21,0,2023-04-12T18:28:40Z,False,False,t2_8vyhj5k4g,15,304,10,106,2023-04-09T17:30:16Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12juh8u/can_delta_or_united_airlines_stock_takeoff/
12jsl5s,DD,$PBI - Pitney Bowes is a Multi Bagger Thanks to Hestia Capital's Activist Crusade,"# Background:

# The original activists who fought alongside Ryan Cohen to refresh brainstop's BoD and oust the CEO are back - this time at Pitney Bowes to do the same exact thing

**Plan** \- By refocusing the company, Hestia plans to:

* wind down the unprofitable GEC (global ecommerce) division
* focus on expanding the profitable segments of the company like presort and sendtech.
* cut costs through marketing and corporate reduction
* restructure debt to avoid a potential credit drop and allow for more breathing room.

Pitney Bowes has a salvageable balance sheet and positive cash flow, so Hestia aren't trying anything too unusual. Read their recently released turnaround presentation for more info since I would only be repeating it.

**Catalysts** \- Obviously there is a long term play to be had, **but the short term is what makes PBI a much more interesting play**. 

Only yesterday, the turnaround presentation was released and within the month, we'll get the results on whether or not Hestia was successful in winning their activist adventure.

If Hestia successfully nominate their slate of directors, the stock could easily rally 20-30% in the span of a few days on turnaround hopes, and with options being so cheap, that would be an easy 5-10 bagger.

For shares, Hestia's price target is $15 over the next few years if their campaign goes well and the turnaround progresses smoothly.

I could wait for Hestia's promised turnaround considering their good track record, but I'm also trying to get rich quick. Shares are cheap at just 3.70, and options are cheaper.

12jm25k,DD,Why $LCID will Dominate the MEA’s $3B+ EV Market," So you all already know that the PIF has upped its stake in Lucid Motors to 65%.

This $3.4 billion investment is definitely an encouraging sign since LCID missed pretty badly in terms of production and delivery numbers last year. But with LCID it's important to remember that, for most of us at least, we are playing the long-game and every EV start up faces huge challenges at the start.

So I want to dive into what I think the PIF’s investment really means for the company since I haven’t seen anyone talking about LCID’s potential to take over the growing EV market in the Middle East.

&#x200B;

# Saudi’s 2030 Vision

If you aren’t familiar with Saudi Arabia’s 2030 Vision plan, then in brief it's the country’s plan for a diversified economy no longer reliant on fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia is doing a lot to achieve these goals including revamping its public image (or at least trying to), constructing smart cities like NEOM, and pushing more of its labor force towards the private sector.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mnf6s2ejbgta1.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=714fd320c29afadce20e8d1b0bed840eb86adb88

But Saudi Arabia has also made it clear that they want a piece of the $246.7B global EV market after their attempts to enter the traditional ICE market failed in the past. Right now, the country is working towards its goal of exporting 150k EV’s in 2026 while at the same time pushing its capital city of Riyadh towards EVs by mandating that 30% of all passenger vehicles driven there are electric by 2030.

The government’s efforts are also affecting how its population views EVs as well. According to a ZAWYA survey of Saudi Arabia done by the global management consulting firm Kearny, 15% of respondents plan to own an EV in the next 3 years while 28% of respondents believed EVs will become common in the future.

I think that the second response makes sense given that Saudi Arabia is estimated to reach 1.3 million EVs on the road by 2030. Ofc there needs to be a total overhaul of the country’s infrastructure to support that. Siemens has partnered with the country to install charging stations on highways and roads and analysts estimate that the country will need between 30k - 34k charging stations to accommodate 70k EVs in Riyadh.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1nv3eb7kbgta1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a8856401b7184ff1c1db0671102c52b61969b31

It's worth noting that there are some challenges Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in general will need to overcome to make this happen. Because - in case you didn’t know - Saudi Arabia is *very* hot. This affects the lifespan of EV batteries and their ability to hold a charge. But there are innovations in battery technology like solid state batteries that could help solve that and companies like Quench Charger are also offering solutions for the MENA region.

So where there is a will, there is a way and with a $600B sovereign wealth fund backing this vision I’m pretty confident that this will be solved. And just to underscore how serious the country is about bringing EVs to the Middle East, Mohammed Bin Salman - the crown prince of Saudi Arabia - actually founded the country’s own EV company in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3rk42e4lbgta1.jpg?width=611&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0defbb2d028093a3f8278f104dab26f8d6c44934

Ceer has a manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia and Lucid’s new EV factory in Saudi Arabia will be completed by 2025-26. Together, Ceer and Lucid are expected to produce 500k EVs PER YEAR starting in 2030 through KSA’s manufacturing hub. LCID is expected to produce at least a quarter of that or roughly 125k cars - a huge increase from last year’s production numbers.

This would be a huge win for Saudi Arabia which has been angling for a piece of the automotive industry pie for quite some time. Not only would the country be exporting a highly desirable product, but its workforce (66% of which is currently employed by the government not only creating a huge drain on the government’s resources but stymieing private sector growth, entrepreneurship, etc.) would be employed in a growing sector - aligning perfectly with the country’s own vision for the future.

# Addressable Market

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sbiub63mbgta1.jpg?width=601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bcd38f8f481fbcf48d619991b70fceab19bf081c

The Middle East is a region known for its financial inequality. It’s definitely not great that the top 1% of Saudi’s own 37.5% of the nation’s wealth and the same can be said about the UAE in which the top 1% own 46.2% of the wealth.

However, in Saudi Arabia’s case this really can’t last. The royal family has a power grip on the nation largely because citizens were not taxed until very recently and citizens benefited from the nation’s Sovereign Wealth Fund as well as cushy government jobs. This isn’t really sustainable since oil and natural gas were the real resources fueling this dynamic.

If the royal family wants to maintain power, it ultimately has to find a way for its population to make a reasonable living without bankrupting the nation or assumably giving up their lavish lifestyles. Considering its bulging youth population, with more than half of Saudi’s population below the age of 25 and about 70% under 30, this is a pressing concern.

Youth unemployment is not a good thing for the monarchy and while the official unemployment rate is around 7%, youth unemployment reached 26.59% in 2021. Youth unemployment represents the percentage of the economically active population aged 15 to 24 who are currently without work but in search of employment. It does not include economically inactive persons such as the long-term unemployed or full-time students.

With the public sector expected to shrink and the country’s economy diversifying, the Saudi government will be pushing its workforce towards private sector work - particularly in the manufacturing sector. The country is already working towards developing 50% of its military gear and hardware within the country and the EV push is occurring in tandem.

Women are also an important component of this labor push, as the Vision 2030 plan outlined the nation’s goals of increasing women’s participation in the overall workforce from 22% to 30% by 2030.

In short, the Vision 2030 plan outlines a complete economic overhaul in an attempt to squash potential unrest in the future, by creating a skilled workforce, expanding the private sector, and creating a manufacturing hub built for the future.

I believe this will do a lot to expand Saudi Arabia’s middle and upper class. Saudi Arabia already has the largest economy and the greatest household wealth within the Middle East. But most of this wealth is spread unevenly. By diversifying its economy, weaning its workforce off of the government, and encouraging new work opportunities within the region, with time its middle and upper class will expand.

However, Saudi Arabia may always be home to some of the world’s wealthiest individuals.For example, the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (aka people with $30 million or more) rose 227% from 2015 to 2020 - the fastest growth rate in the world at the time. According to a Citibank report from 2011, Saudi Arabia was also predicted to become the 6th richest economy by 2050.

Whether or not that prediction still stands, Saudi Arabia is taking the steps right now to create a better economy for its citizens. With this in mind, I believe LCID stands to benefit a lot from Saudi support and access to its market.

For one thing, Saudis seem to love luxury cars since they make up more than 18% of the total imported cars in Saudi Arabia. The country imports pretty much everything and cars are no exception so I’m sure people would jump at the chance to own a LCID vehicle manufactured in Saudi Arabia. Especially since the price of gas in Saudi Arabia has been fluctuating over the last 4 years:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v57rrs3nbgta1.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a658a0d5f8891e77eab46cb002668894e1bd11f7

The government of Saudi Arabia is also doing its best to promote Lucid’s vehicles as well since it has agreed to purchase 100,000 vehicles from LCID over the next 10 years. These cars will be for government-related employees to use which could do a lot to increase awareness and brand exposure in the region.

# Expansion

This brings me to my next point, if Saudi Arabia is throwing all of its weight behind LCID and its country’s expansion into the EV sector, then the next logical step is to start exporting these vehicles to neighboring countries.

Saudi Arabia is already a powerhouse in the region and it has ties to some of the most developed countries in the gulf. So I think it's going to draw upon these relationships once the new Lucid factory starts manufacturing 150 thousand cars each year by exporting these luxury EVs to the rest of the region.

There is a huge market opportunity for EVs in the Middle East, with countries like the UAE, Bahrain, and Oman--along with other countries in the region– announcing their net-zero targets. However the UAE is probably the best market to begin exporting to since its primed for EV adoption.

&#x200B;

According to a report from the consultancy firm - Arthur D. Little - the UAE is one of the emerging EV markets according to its market readiness. This was determined based on factors driving EV adoption like macroeconomics, competition, regulation, customer readiness, the total cost of ownership, and of course public charging infrastructure. According to a survey from Audi Abu Dhabi, a little over half of UAE residents are considering switching to hybrid or electric vehicles due to the cost of fuel.

This is even in line with the UAE’s stated goals of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, a full ten years before Saudi Arabia hopes to. To achieve this goal, the UAE government converted 20% of its official vehicles to EVs and is planning to put 42k EVs on its road by 2030. In preparation, the UAE has already installed over 1,500 public charging stations but will need to add more as EV adoption ramps up. But as is, it actually has the highest ratios of charging stations to EVs.

It's also a good sign that the UAE is hosting the Electric Vehicle Innovation Summit in May. The summit will bring together industry leaders, policy makers, and experts to discuss developments in the EV market. It appears that the UAE is taking the transition to EVs very seriously since NWTN Motors - a green mobility company - is building a 25,000 sm facility for EV R&D and manufacturing in the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi.

So the market for EV’s in the UAE is already there, and it is projected to grow at an annual rate of 30% from 2022 to 2028 due to rising fuel prices, national net-zero emissions commitments, and consumer base that has become increasingly environmentally aware.

Of course, there needs to be the proper infrastructure in place for LCID’s vehicles to take off. But I think the UAE has an excellent market for this. The two countries have a great relationship, and the UAE is known all over the world for its luxury cars and rich lifestyles. This tells me that there could be a market for Lucid’s vehicles in the UAE which already appears primed for the transition towards electric vehicles.

In 2021, Tesla made up roughly half of the UAE’s electric vehicle market. But the Lucid Air Pure is not only $12k cheaper than the Tesla Model S, but it has better performance, a better driving range, and a luxurious design which could put it in direct competition with Tesla and Porsche.

# Conclusion

While the completion of LCID’s KSA factory and Saudi Arabia’s targets for exporting 150k EV’s in 2026 are still a long way off, I can’t help but feel bullish on LCID. With this massive sovereign wealth fund backing up on the brand - not to mention the country itself making EV manufacturing such a pivotal part of its economic goals and plans for the future - I think LCID has a shot at becoming a major player in the Middle East market.

The UAE’s focus on EV adoption and the transition towards environmental awareness in other gulf countries is also a promising sign. I personally feel like there is synergy between the region’s affection for luxury cars and Lucid’s design too.

So - in summary - with Saudi Arabia planning to invest $50B in EV production over the next decade & LCID building a new factory in the country, I think that long-term LCID will recover despite it making a new all time low at the start of this year.

So what do you guys think? Is there potential for LCID to see widespread adoption in the Middle East or is this a pipedream?",InternationalWash822,15,0.76,21,0,0,21,10,2023-04-12T13:20:13Z,False,False,t2_tix9la0u,84,6,7,0,2022-10-29T17:10:13Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12jm25k/why_lcid_will_dominate_the_meas_3b_ev_market/

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Are Tastier Than a Michelin Star Meal 🌟🖍️

If you think technical analysis and indicator-based trading are as dull as dishwater, you're in for a treat! We're using past price performance to predict price levels today, just like how I predict my next insult in Hell's Kitchen.

Our analysis uses option open interest to whip up a tasty concoction of portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma. Once we've got those, we can simulate how they change at different price points. Then we find the sweet spot where portfolio-level gamma is sky-high and delta is close to zilch. 🎯

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts like a soufflé on a trampoline off delta neutral, gamma max, or both. We're using these reactions to drive trading signals that'll make you richer than a chocolate lava cake. 🍫

Our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, reflecting the expected size and duration of reactions from gamma max or delta neutral. Most of these plays are more profitable than a restaurant during Restaurant Week. The best ones benefit from both the directional move and the increase in IV.

## Notes - Tips to Make You Smarter Than a Kitchen Sponge 🧽

* If the price has moved past the entry price, be careful! Something's changed since these plays were generated, and it might not be as tasty as it was before.
* Sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest like a master sushi chef. 🍣
* I risk up to 1% of my total capital on trades. If I'm feeling less confident, I'll only risk 0.5% or 0.25% and dollar cost average in.
* Trades were calculated before market open, so they're based on yesterday's info. Keep that in mind if you're entering late, as new price movement may spoil the original thesis.

## FAQ - Questions You've Already Asked, You Donkey! 🐴

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear? 🌈🐻
   * No. The companies just had a run-up that makes them look overextended, like a soufflé that's about to collapse. These trades are mean-reverting toward or away from important price levels.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There's been a shortage of plays in the WSB morning talks, so I'm sharing more plays with a probable edge to help you apes get that gain porn. Pick your favorites, and let the gains flow! 🦍💰
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play replaces the old one. The old play is now as useless as a dull knife. Don't chase the price—remember, a new day's worth of data has been produced.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 🖍️
   * Click the links above, you muppet!
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error) – not too shabby!
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%.

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Possess a Most Delectable Flavor 🎩

As our forefathers before us, technical analysis and indicator-based trading look to the past price performance to predict today's crucial price levels.

This analysis hinges upon the current option open interest. Armed with that option open interest, it computes portfolio-level greeks—most notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once these greeks are established at the portfolio level, I can now simulate the change in greeks at various price points. From thence, I can discern the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest and the portfolio-level delta is close to naught.

For certain tickers, the underlying price reacts most vigorously off of delta neutral, gamma max, and occasionally both.

It is the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is employed to drive trading signals.

The plays and target entry prices provided are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflects the expected magnitude and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A great many of these plays are profitable due to underlying moves in stock. The finest plays benefit from both the directional move and the increase in IV.

## Notes - A Wrinkle in Your Brain, Courtesy of Honest Abe 📜

* If the price has advanced beyond the entry price, proceed with caution. Something has shifted betwixt the time these plays were generated and the market's opening.
* Endeavor to sell half your position upon doubling, and freeroll the remainder to exit at your discretion.
* I am inclined to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I undertake. If my conviction is lesser, I shall allocate a mere 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in.
* These trades were calculated prior to the market's opening, and thus are based on information up until yesterday. Keep this in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may render the original thesis null and void.

## FAQ - Inquiries Answered by the Great Emancipator Himself 🎩

* These plays are mostly puts. Art thou a gay bear?
  * Nay. It so happens that the companies have experienced a recent run-up, suggesting they are overextended. These trades are primarily a form of mean reversion, either toward or away from a significant price level.
* Art thou entering all these plays?
  * Nay. There has been a scarcity of plays in the WSB morning discussions, and so I have expanded my bag of tools slightly to highlight more plays with a probable edge, in order to guide apes toward greater gainful imagery. Peruse this curated list of plays, select those that appeal to you based on any additional analysis you employ, and acquire that gainful imagery.
* Thou hast mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What dost that signify?
  * The new play should supplant the old play. The old play is likely now invalid, and if thou hast not entered, do not pursue the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data hath been produced, and the newer play reflects that data, whereas the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I see only words.
  * Click the links above, my good sir or madam.
* Hast thou back-tested this?
  * Indeed. Results display a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error).
* What is the historical performance?
  * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. Based on the trade performance thus far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will fall between 63% and 75%.

12enr0x,DD,"The week of CPI and FOMC Minutes… 4-6-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Weekly Market Recap and Analysis (DD is back!)","Hey guys so I know over the last week I haven’t been able to post on reddit because I unfortunately got my accounts suspended by the reddit admin again… I wasn’t able to reply to any comments or chats unfortunately.  I will ALWAYS find a way to post and once again NEVER assume that i just abandoned you guys... 

**We are taking a family trip to Disney next week and I will be gone until Thursday night… next daily/ weekly ta will be posted on April 14th. I will not be trading during this time.** 

**CPI**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvk6zn8e6hsa1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a64bb326fbd4457ee78d3589f6a6d8c838f247fc

We will officially get CPI on Wednesday. As of now its actually more interesting to see what the numbers are going to be then not. As of right now CPI YoY is pretty much a guaranteed beat, and CPI MoM is most likely to also beat (be lower than previous).

Now where things are going to get interesting and where I truly once again after 3-4 months of opens that have done nothing but burn everyone on CPI can no recommend anyone play CPI… But Core YoY is as of now likely to miss (be higher than previous) and there is a decent chance that Core MoM is unchanged or misses too… 

If we get a miss on CORE I could see a pretty negative market reaction. In the end CORE should have more weight than that of CPI. Here are my thoughts… If we get a good CPI (so lower than previous) then there is a pretty solid chance the pivot narrative is going to increase and we could very well rally for 2 weeks into the next FOMC. However, IF CORE is higher there is a pretty solid chance that we could continue to price in a 25bps hike.. If we do that then we are likely to see choppy ranges to a slightly sell off over the next two weeks. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vl2refch6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a93f00a970ce47bdde6013b9bd45d32ddeaa79dd

Currently we actually (kinda surprising) have a 67.4% chance of a 25bps hike on May 3rds FOMC. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a45pvjph6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d6ce16775ca6740aceb02af70bccc640cca8fa96

Now what is extra spicy and extra unique about this Wednesdays CPI release is that at 830am we have CPI numbers dropping, however, we also have the FOMC minutes releasing at 2pm the same day. Both of these days are extremely volatile in and of themselves. Add the fires together and its going to be a very interesting day to say the least! 

One thing I find interesting with FOMC minutes AND CPI being Wednesday is that the IV is very low still sitting at 16% currently. I do expect this to ramp up as the week comes into Wednesday though. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/47wwg75i6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=58ddba0992b08e1ed0fede76797d1a73cad60b33

Daily wise we once again attempted to break down and touch 405.17 supply (now support) however we unable to get there once again. I mentioned last week that IF the daily is in extreme bull momentum (which we are) then we should likely look to the daily 8ema to provide a bounce on any sort of sell off. Well we have officially touched and bounced off the daily 8ema. 

The favortism now goes to if we get a green day Monday to see a new demand (support) put in at 406.64 which then leads to yet again another run to 411.04 if not 414.13 to 417.03. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/69isveji6hsa1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=de04d01bdb801f159db132dc140d0a7705af6adb

From a weekly perspective we have once again found ourselves attempting to breach that 409.98 supply (resistance) and have not been able to do that. If and when we break through that then we could very well see a push to that next major supply (resistance) at 427.53. 

Now this is where the Daily and Weekly team differs. On SPY daily we are closer to putting in a new demand (support) then we are putting in a new supply (resistance), however, when we look at the weekly we are in the process of putting in a new supply (resistance). 

Spy Daily is also in extreme bull momentum while the weekly has bullish momentum but it is not extreme. 

On the weekly time frame one should expect a continuation upside with a ultimate target of 427.53 until we put in a new supply (resistance) at between here and 427.53. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5egghy0j6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=10533317159883362b077c7218f98a72cccdd88a

Now as you can see we have a black bull channel that we have been trading in since basically the day after the March FOMC meeting. This channel gives us a Monday support at 407.7 and resistance at 418.5 (don’t expect that just meaning the upside potential is the greatest). We also have 6 days of not backtesting the daily 8ema have officially backtested and bounced off the daily 8ema. This should allow for once again further upside momentum. 

Now I would have liked to see a more official back test of 405.2 support, however, one could infer the last two days to be a test of that 405-406 support area and that should once again provide upside lift. 

Now that the bulls have had a relief sell off there potential for the upside increases. Realistically it is unwise to bet against the upside here as long as we are holding the daily 8ema and holding 405.2 support. Ultimately the bulls target should be 419.5.

Now while I am bullish there is something we need to talk about on the daily and that is the fact that we have three GAPS left at 396.49 to 398.68, 401.6 to 401.76 and 404.35 to 404.55. Now while a 10-15 cent gap alone could be negligible enough to never be filled a almost $2 gap most certainly will at some point need to be fill… That with the fact on SPY we have a supply at 399.07 and on futures we have supplies at 4015, 4040 and 4055 that NEED to be “take out” to balance the market there is very little doubt in my mind that any upside potential we have on SPY/ futures is temporary. 

What I mean by this is that yes I am BULLISH and I even think CPI could propel us to the 420-430 area leading into FOMC if we get good enough data (as I believe the pause/ pivot narrative will likely escalate again) the markets left a huge imbalance (for lack of a better way to explain it) in the 393 to 399 area that at some point will need to be corrected before we can not only move higher but sustain higher lows. This has been a fairly common theme on SPY for the last year that from a technical stand point we get huge moves and breakouts but we leave such imbalances below that we HAVE to at some point “fix” the price action below before we can continue higher and sustain higher. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACITON**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1rfx10hj6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=66280ea6586ebc4de00c42f6e917049378c8ad36

SPY weekly finds itself sitting in a massive year long breakout/ breakdown triangle currently as you can see by the black lines. This means that IF and when we break this triangle we very well could see a pretty explosive move one away or another. 

Currently resistance for next week sits at 412.5 and support at 386.9. Now one thing that is interesting to me here is that we have been in a 4 week long red bull channel, however, after last weeks pretty impressive move up we actually closed out a 409.23 weekly double top with a doji reversal candle. Weekly support lies at 407.1 and resistance at 423.3. 

Why does a weekly doji candle matter? Well if you look at every single weekly hard stop/ top then you will see they all are some form of a doji candle. This very well could turn into a weekly double top/ doji bearish reversal. 

However, if we break through that 412.5 resistance and breakout of this triangle then there is a chance that we could see a bigger push to retest the resistance of the august highs near 427.25. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4010 -> 427.5  
 Demand- 385.9  
 Support- 407.3 -> 404 -> 398.1  
 Resistance- 409.3 -> 412.7 -> 417.1

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7ct5exj6hsa1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5263bf7eed53c02f6c2d3a853406b091cb9ac98

SPY and Futures have a pretty strong correlation right now in their technicals and price action similar set up here that we are seeing a pretty nice a hard rejection at 4154-4160 that led to the daily 8ema retest and support bounce with the current extreme bull momentum that we are in. 

Now while we are looking to establish a new demand (support) the one thing that I have as a possible concern here on futures is that double supply (resistance) set at 4154 to 4160. This level could provide a pretty impressive rejection if we do not have the proper support and momentum to take us higher. However, if bulls can break through that then we are likely to see a new demand (support) established near 4113 and put in an upside resistance test at 4198. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y0li5jck6hsa1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ddd06b3263b2c218e3f4a0d876193d4935a1071

Weekly here very similar to spy weekly in that we just can not seem for the 3rd week in a row now to be able to close over that 4149 weekly supply (resistance) that was established back in January. This level likely is to provide heavy resistance and bulls are 100% going to need a close over that level if they have any sort of hope for a push to the next supply which is a very generous target of 4284. 

However, if we find ourselves once again under the 4149 weekly supply at close Friday we very well could reconfirm this level as a supply (resistance) which could lead to a retest of 4054 if not 3918. However, once again favortism remains to the upside and I still find it unwise to be against the current upside momentum. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kzhi93yk6hsa1.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18c5b9059b9631db65412e9ecbf2d918e38b4f00

Futures also continues to be in a black bull channel for the last 2 weeks (since FOMC). With the pretty impressive breakout followed by a retest of the daily 8ema the last two weeks the favortism definitely goes to the upside here. However, as you can see we have a pretty impressive 4153 double top that we are going to need to break through first. IF and when we break through that 4153 resistance my target would still be the February high of 4193. 

While we did not test 405.2 support on SPY we did bounce off (within 1 point) of 4095 daily support on futures. This support bounce along with the daily 8ema bounce should be seen as a pretty important support bounce and confirmation of the up trend. 

I much like SPY would highly caution anyone from shorting SPY in its current uptrend and momentum. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uprh9zcl6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7eba95e349f94b014452735cf9bd735bf1dd9fe5

Futures has found itself in the same exact breakout/ down triangle that SPY has been in for the last year now. This triangle has a resistance at 4158 and support at 3900. Now the one interesting thing here (mostly because futures is trading while spy is not) is that it did break its 4 week long black bull channel. 

With that support being broken and as of now a rejection at the 4138-4148 level we very well could be looking at a weekly top here. 

One thing I want to factor in here is the JPM collar. We currently have the call side at 4300 (remember these are sold calls) and puts at 3860. Now historically speaking over the last about 2 years of trading we have always come within 100pts of the sold JPM calls or broken over then. That does mean over the next 3 months we very well could expect to see a push to 4200-4300 on futures. 

However, one other factor I would really like to highlight is the 7 week trend. This trend assumes that the 7 weeks post JPM collar roll generally is a trend followed by weeks 8 to 11 being a reversal. 

So for instance we should see either a push or drop from now until the week of May 15th followed by a reversal. So lets assume we go on a nice 7 week long bull run (again) that means we could target that 4300 sold calls area over the next 7 weeks and then from May 15th to June 12th we are likely to see a pretty sizeable pullback. 

However, IF much like some of the technicals are slightly hinting at we see a 7 week drop leading into May 15th with a potential target of 3860 then we could from May 15th to June 12th see a recovery. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4054 -> 4149 -> 4284  
 Demand- 3919  
 Support- 4095 -> 4077 -> 4008  
 Resistance- 4149 -> 4222

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p9rktnul6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2397aea96bd8240db3bf446f93ed361c6c303700

Now looking at the VIX here this is where in my opinion things get a little interesting and shows that we could go either way. 

While from a realistic stand point I see very few reasons to bet against the bullishness of this market (at least until a new macro event happens… que the credit event…) the VIX does tell a slighty different story than that of the markets. 

Now if we take a look at every “top” of SPY daily over the last few months the “bottom” of the VIX was put in at 18.01, 17.06, 18.11, and 18.16. that means on average the “bottom” of the VIX was seen at an average of 17.84. with 18.01 to 18.16 being the biggest bounce area to watch. 

The VIX closed Friday at 18.39 which is nearing that key pivot point of the 17s on the VIX. 

The VIX in my opinion is saying the next temporary top on SPY is much closer than the next bottom is. However, the one thing I have learned once again over the last month on the VIX is that unless we have sustained (meaning back to back to back) bad news or more importantly unless the markets have continued reasons to sell off any sort of dip is likely to be bought back up very quickly and the VIX is very likely to sell off very quickly too. 

One thing I have said all year on the on the markets is that “markets NEED a reason to not only sell off but to CONTINUE to sell off…” Take a look at the bank run… markets went into a huge panic and dump impressively for a few days and then what happened? The feds/ government “smoothed” it over and boom all of a sudden no worries, no panic nothing and we rocketed once again… I mean jeeze take a look at the last FOMC… JPOW himself said “we will NOT cut rates this year… that is NOT our base case.” And what did the markets do? They said I hear you JPOW but we are going to go ahead and price in another rate cut just because we don’t believe you that much. 

We are in a place right now where the markets being forward looking do not believe the fed and we have once again found ourselves in a time of good news is good and bad news is good too. 

This is a very tough time to be a bear but despite a potential run on SPY to 420 and futures to 4200-4284 I do still think that our upside is limited enough where its best to trade this intraday. If and when we finally hit 415+ again I think some 4-6 month out puts could be a golden ticket play though. 

**DAILY/ WEEKLY TRADING LOGS**

Since I wasn’t able to post to reddit the last week or so im going to include my whole week of daily logs and then my usually weekly summary. 

&#x200B;

Overall a very small profit week. I went into this week expecting 405.2 to be hard resistance and that we would end up back near 393-395 by the EOW. However, I quickly realized I was 100% on the wrong side of things once we hard broke 405.2. I was able to average down on my long puts and take a more manageable -19.1% loss. The most frustrating thing about those puts was the way they moved. Now granted I was pretty far OTM it just seemed like a 10 cent move away from me was devastating while a $1 move in my direction barely did anything to recover my profits. 

Outside of that I was able to make quite a few nice scalps this week and my level to level trading was pretty solid. The biggest issue of this week once again was lack of continuation. The theme this week appeared to be a push/ move one way followed by 2-3 hours of untradeable chop/ lack of continuation followed by EOD rallies once again. I consistently seemed to have great mornings and then would find myself giving it all back in that mid day chop. 

From a technical stand point we had every single sign of a great setup to trade I mean like 100% of my confirmation I wanted for a trade only to end up with a move in the direction of expectation and then an even bigger irrational move against me. 

The one thing I noticed the last 2-3 weeks is that I have taken far more trades then usual and my win rate has been lower but I remain profitable. This mostly in my opinion is related to trusting my trading system and entries and taking all the high probability setups that I see. However, I am also cutting my losers must faster than ever before. I recognize when a technical goes against me and my position and I am taking a -3% to -6% loser instead of just riding to my stop loss.

12eaweo,DD,Nicotine = Recession King,"I am once again asking for you to look at $MO (Altria) and $PM (Philip Morris). Why? Beyond it’s the typical recession Play you have three really important things going right now….  
1. 8% inflation busting yield.  
2. IQOS heated tobacco around the corner, all smoking fun and taste no cancer as far as we know. It’s already legal in most Europe and Middle East only patents disputes exist here. I’ve personally tried it and it’s amazing, assuming the no cancer part is true.  
3. Cancer in general might be on the verge of ending with mRNA and AI advancements. Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine that is highly effective but prohibited here due to it being Cuba and not profitable for pharma.  
4. Strong indications that nicotine may inhibit the ace2 receptors for corona. Objectively very few homeless died from rona (active smokers). So some medical benefits yet to be unveiled and these guys are buying biotechs.  
5. They are still about 20% down on the year vs complete junk that’s still growing. These guys have high profit margin, high dividends, and recession proof products.  
And for those reasons I’m in on both $MO and $PM. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.",trumpdiego,79,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,2023-04-07T05:19:51Z,False,False,t2_12ernt,709,7755,21,3363,2016-10-27T05:14:13Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12eaweo/nicotine_recession_king/

## Trading Thesis - To Infinity and Beyond! 🚀

Technical analysis and indicator-based trading are like navigating the galaxy to predict important price levels today. 🌌

This analysis is based on the current option open interest, like a space map for portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma. Once we've plotted our course, we can simulate the change in greeks at different price points, like warp speed! 💫

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both, just like a rocket blasting off. 🚀

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflects the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. The best plays benefit from the directional move and the increase in IV, like catching a comet's tail. 🌠

## Notes - A little space dust for your helmet

If the price has moved past the entry price, hit the brakes! 🛑 Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. Sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion, like a daring space escape. 🪐

## FAQ - Because others have already asked, like curious little aliens

- *These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?* No, it's just that some companies have had a recent run-up, like a rocket that's overextended. 🚀
- *Are you entering all these plays?* No, I'm just opening my bag of space tools wider to help fellow space cadets find more gain porn. 🌠
- *You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?* The new play should replace the old play, like a shiny new spaceship. 🛸
- *Where are the crayons? I only see words.* Click the links above, like pressing buttons on a control panel. 🖍️
- *Have you back-tested this?* Yes, results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error). 📈
- *What is the historical performance?* The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31) 📊

12cv1vc,DD,Ahem… as I was saying on $UWMC…,"Posted some loss porn a few months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x9pda4/its_time_will_come/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1), but also included some DD that got lost in the comments that I believe is worth repeating…

•	⁠Am I highly regarded? CERTAINLY.
•	⁠Is my wife browsing AshleyMadison.com right now? PROBABLY.
•	⁠Will my kids still be able to go to college? UNLIKELY.
•	⁠But will it eventually print $$? DEFINITELY!

Long forgotten by the WSB community, this stock is legit! CEO basically said “I’ll fuck myself to fuck my competitors” and has dropped margins so low that they’re literally putting their competitors out of business one by one. And it’s working! loanDepot Wholesale? GONE. AmeriSave Wholesale? GONE. Sprout Mortgage? GONE. Homepoint? HUGE LAYOFFS. Rocket? HUGE LAYOFFS. Wells Fargo? HUGE LAYOFFS.

Ok so they can starve out the competition. That’s cool, but are they actually good at what they do? HELL FUCKING YES! This company has completely changed the game for mortgages. Where an average loan takes 44 days to complete, these guys get it done in <20 days. With ~8,000 employees, more than 1,000 of them are in IT. This is a tech company that happens to do mortgages! And they have high standards for who they hand out loans to (620+ credit score required). So while many of us irresponsible morons wouldn’t qualify for their services, the people who do qualify actually pay their mortgage on time each month, allowing them to build a hugely valuable collection of MSRs.

YEAH BUT…

•	⁠Isn’t buying into the mortgage sector in 2022 kinda like purposely slamming a car door on my dick? No! Well yes, but this is the exception. This is the ONLY lender currently growing their purchase business, and they just rolled out a HELOC product that is going to be huge. And with their competitors dropping like English Queens (too soon?), they are poised for explosive growth.
•	⁠Well it’s not like this would be a super easy squeeze play, right? ACTUALLY, this might just be the easiest squeeze of all time. 93% of all shares are held by the CEO’s family, and the company has authorized hundreds of millions in buy-backs. The public float is only 7% and the current short interest is >23%! This could be squeezed like your mom’s titties when she’s stripping to help you cover your margin calls!
•	⁠Ok, but it’s not like there’s a dividend, right? HA! Not only is there a 0.10/quarter dividend (currently equating to 11.1% yield!), but the CEO has explicitly said over and over that the divvy is NOT going away. And why would he want it to? His family owns 1.5 billion shares! This divvy isn’t going anywhere!
•	⁠If they’re actually so good, why haven’t I heard of them? This may be the most incredible part of the business model. $UWMC is a wholesale lender. That means they don’t work directly with the public. Their ‘customers’ are the 40,000+ independent mortgage brokers across the U.S. who do all of the legwork to secure borrowers and then broker those loans to UWM. That means no bloated marketing budgets, and every customer they acquire is delivering loan after loan after loan! The borrower doesn’t even know that UWM exists until they get their first statement, and UWM has no reason to care if Joe and Jane Fuxalot know who they are, which means all that marketing money that other lenders are spending gets poured into technology at UWM!

BOTTOM LINE… Am I down a sickening amount of money? Yes, and I have voluntarily given up my belts, shoelaces, and sharp objects for the foreseeable future. But am I selling? Fuck no! This stock is the perfect storm of great company, ruthlessly aggressive leadership, huge dividend, and high short interest. Their CEO will not stop until he has put every competitor out of business. If the retail traders are too regarded to squeeze this thing, it’s still going to go up organically. And when the cyclical mortgage market inevitably turns around (which will be after many other companies have gone out of business), the share price is going to explode.

But WTF do I know? I’m not a financial advisor. I’m just a guy who lost the better part of a hundred grand on Robinhood, but damn well believes this stock’s time is coming sooner than later. This is not financial advice, and if you listen to me without doing your own research, then you truly belong on WSB.

## 🖍️ Trading Thesis - The Art of Tasty Crayons, Marine Style!

Listen up, maggots! We're gonna talk about some crayons that taste better than your mama's apple pie! 🥧

Technical analysis? Indicator-based trading? Pfft! That's for sissies! We use past price performance to predict today's prices like a true warrior! 💪

Now, we're gonna dive into the nitty-gritty of option open interest. With that, we calculate portfolio-level greeks, like Delta and Gamma. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded! 🙈

Some tickers react like a grenade when they hit delta neutral, gamma max, or even both! 💥 We use those reactions to drive our trading signals like a tank through enemy lines! 🚀

Our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, reflecting the size and duration of the reaction. It's like playing Battleship, but with stocks! 🚢

## **Notes - Wrinkle your brain, soldier!** 🧠

- If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious like a sniper in a ghillie suit! 🎯
- Sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest like a high-stakes poker game! ♠️
- Risk up to 1% of your capital on trades, or less if you're feeling like a scaredy-cat! 🐱
- Trades are calculated before market open, so keep that in mind when entering late, slowpoke! ⏰
- New price movement may invalidate the original thesis, so stay sharp! 🔪

## **FAQ - Got questions, private?** 🤔

- Are these plays mostly puts? Yes, but I ain't no gay bear! 🐻
- Entering all these plays? Heck no! I'm just showing you apes some more plays for that sweet gain porn! 🦍💰
- New play on the same ticker? Out with the old, in with the new! 🔄
- Where are the crayons? Click the links, dummy! 🖍️
- Back-tested this? You bet your boots! Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate! 📊

## **Historical performance?** 

Realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31) 📈

12bxitm,DD,Cano Health ($CANO): A WSB wet dream and ripe for a huge run,"I have been following this stock since it went public and strongly believe this thing can go 3-4x at a minimum, in the next six months. TLDR: $CANO 7/21/23 calls $3.00.

1. The stock has been trading mostly on capital markets news and not operating performance. It IPO'd in June 2020 through a SPAC sponsored by Starwood Capital's Barry Sternlicht, at $10.
2. The stock went up a little.. then down a little.. pretty much trading sideways for 18 months. Theta gang was fucking PRINTING.
3. Then came November 2021 and the company missed on revenue estimates. Its a fucking healthcare company who had been enjoying all the fruits the pandemic had to offer. Of course their revenue growth is going to slowdown once the pandemic ends.
4. The stock went from $11 to just over $5 by Jan 2022 and traded sideways for a few months.
5. Then in September 2022 rumors began to surface that CVS was in talks to acquire the Cano. The stock doubled over the next six weeks, to just under $10.
6. Just when a deal seemed imminent, CVS says they're no longer interested.. FUCKKKKK. Stock plummets to $2, then falls a little more before settling in around $1.50 a share.
7. Last week Barry Sternlicht and two other board members announced they are leaving the board and release a scathing letter calling Cano CEO Marlow Hernandez a crayon eating regard. Stock drops 30% to a low of $0.78 a share.
8. On Monday, Barry Sternlicht and his buddies register as a group with the SEC. In the filing they say they are banding together to use their 35% voting power to 1. Fuck the CEO right out of the company 2. Sell off non-core assets and 3. MAXIMIZE shareholder value. Stock almost doubles from its lows to $1.35 where it is now.
9. Notice a trend here? Fucking corporate drama everywhere. Has anyone even been paying attention to the companies operating performance?
10. If your saying to yourself, ""this cant all be just because of drama, the company must be struggling."" Congratulations, you're smarter than 99% of the people in this sub. The company has been struggling. They burned through most of the cash they raised in the IPO through M&A. Buuuuut, that M&A also helped them grow their revenue from $1.6 billion in 2021 to $2.74 billion in 2022. For those of you who are mathematically challenged thats a 71% increase year over year.
11. Based on todays share price, Cano's market cap is 707 million. Thats 0.25x revenue. That's dirt fucking cheap.
12. Some of you may have heard the name Oak Street Health in the news lately. After backing out of the Cano acquisition, CVS looked at Oak Street and just agreed to acquire them for 10 billion. Go take a look at both companies, they are nearly identical in every way, including financially. Oak Street had 2021 revenue of 1.4 billion and 2022 revenue of 2.1 billion. Thats worse than Cano in terms of absolute $ and growth %. Oak Street has also been posting way bigger losses than Cano. Why CVS wants them idk but it provides a peg for us to value off.
13. Big Dick Barry is going to seize control of this company and remove Marlo's testicles through his anus. Then he is going to sell it to the highest bidder, thank fucking god for BDB.
14. A 10 billion enterprise value would put this stock at $15 a share... if you don't know what enterprise value is, you can stop reading and go buy calls, July expiration to buy some time and strike anywhere from $2 to $5 depending on what you can afford.
15. This stock is either going to zero or $7+ in the next six months. Barry will make sure of it.
16. The thing is, the options market isn't pricing in this kind of volatility, i mean how often do you see a stock go 4x in six months?
17. Its a 50/50 gamble but the payout is 10-15 to 1. Thats a good fucking bet if you ask me.
18. If you think im only here to pump my book, you're right.. but that doesnt mean im wrong. Get on board boys. This is a small cap name that we can take to the moon! The icing on the cake would be a short squeeze, which could easily happen with a small cap like this, but we dont even need it. This company is going to get sold in the next six months for a multiple of its current value.

This is not financial advice, i am in no way capable of providing financial advice and if you listen to me you are regarded (or smart, idk yet but time will tell). Fuck you and God Bless. Positions in comments.

12bsszu,DD,It's finally time for the silver surfers to ride another wave. Breakout from a 2 year flag is underway,"The price chart looks fantastic as it's broken out of a two year massive bull flag

The silver to copper ratio has bounced mightily off of long term support and is nowhere near any top signals

Silver shines in stagflationary times and we're entering another period of intense stagflation

We can all load up on QQQ leaps in 2028 after this thing has run it's course. But for the next few years, precious metals and commodities are the place to be!

I'm long physical silver, platinum, and gold, as well as a bevy of metal and commodity etfs and individual stocks. I don't want my post to get taken down for mentioning tickers due to the market caps of even the ETFs being too low.

Edit: saw people complaining about paying premiums or VAT taxes (Europe) when buying silver. PSLV is the silver ETF I use and is not below the mkt cap restriction. PHYS for gold if you want that. SILJ for miners. ETFs mean no premiums and it’s highly liquid, just have to pay normal ETF fees

12bldk2,DD,Regional Banks are significantly undervalued after SVB failure. Risk is abating and outflow of deposits hasn't been realized in recent data.,"Regional banks are still trading \~30% lower than late-Feb, just prior to SVB's colapse, and also below their pre-covid. See $KRE, $IAT, $DPST, $KBWR etc.. its been close to a month since the colapse and this drop is begining to look unjustified. There was concern that continued outflow of deposits would weigh on the regional bank's profits but recent weekly data from the Federal Reserve shows this fear was overblown. See the following table on small commerical bank deposite in the US over the last year:

Table 9. Assets and Liabilities of Small Domestically Chartered Commercial Banks in the United States:

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm)

https://preview.redd.it/3rtr581lnvra1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a28413de395d55b35b78bc9ef4a962bf90f9ece3

Deposits at small commercial banks (defined as not in the top 25 by deposit size) have only decreased by 2.3% since Feb 2022. From the same source you can see that total deposits at the larger banks (top 25) have only declined 4.5% and the rate of decline is slowing. This is not the deluge of outflows folks were worried about. Banks don't do poorly in a rising interest rate enviroment, they just keep taking their spread on lending. SVB was a very unique situation where it exposed itself to excess duration risk while simultaneously not managing its reputation risk (thanks to shotty stragey by Goldman). The risks SVB was exposed to are not shared by the other regional banks. Especially after backstop measures were put in place by the FDIC, ample loans were given out by the Fed, and larger commercial banks stepped in to provided deposits to smaller banks. As a result, we haven't seen another bank run since SVB on March 9th or Signature on March 12th. 

All this is to say the crisis was overblown and we are still seeing a market price inefficieny. The trade here is medium dated (6-9 month) call options on the regional bank ETFs. The longer we go without another failure the more these banks will re-rate. For the really spicy traders out there you can get even more leverage on calls with the 3x leveraged $DPST ETF (note implied vol is higher with these options to reflect the increased volatility of the underlying).

Happy to hear any counter arguments or risks that I haven't highlighted in this analysis. You could argue the fundamentals of these bank's profitability has been affected by the colapse, but I'd argue that would be reflected as an outflow of deposits, which we have not seen at any large scale.",lifeaquatic34,69,0.75,61,0,0,61,1,2023-04-04T14:48:32Z,False,False,t2_3xmdx1x8,4,741,4,710,2019-10-06T15:28:55Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12bldk2/regional_banks_are_significantly_undervalued/

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons are Zoinks-delicious! 🌈

Like Scooby and the gang solving mysteries, technical analysis clues us in on past prices 💰 to predict those groovy levels today. But guess what, gang? We're adding a twist! 🌀

Our analysis is based on option open interest, which helps us calculate those ever-elusive greeks like Delta and Gamma. Once we get our paws 🐾 on 'em, we can simulate price points and find the sweet spot where gamma's highest and delta is chillin' at 0. 🎯

Some tickers make waves 🌊 off of delta neutral, gamma max, or both! It's these reactions that we use to whip up our trading signals.

Givin' ya the 411 on plays and target entry prices, we use a binomial option pricing model that reflects the expected size and duration from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are groovy baby, just like those Scooby Snacks! 🍪 The best plays benefit from the directional move and a dash of IV. 😎

## Notes - Because Knowledge is Power 🧠💥

* If the price scoots by the entry price, be cautious! Something's fishy 🐟 between play generation and market open.
* Look to sell half your position on a double, then freeroll the rest at your discretion. Like, wow! 😃
* I like to toss 1% of my total capital into trades, but if my conviction's lower, I throw in 0.5% or 0.25% instead. DCA, baby! 💸
* Remember, trades are 📝 before market open, so keep your peepers peeled for changes! 👀

## FAQ - Howdy, Mystery Solver! 🕵️‍♂️

* These plays are mostly puts. Am I a gay bear? 🐻
   * Nope! Some companies just had a wild roller coaster ride 🎢, and it's time for some good ol' mean-reversion.
* Am I entering all these plays? 
   * Nah. These happen to be from my grab-bag of tricks 🃏 for days when WSB morning talks lack plays with probable edges. So follow the clues, pick your faves, and enjoy that gain porn. 💪
* Saw a new play on the same ticker before. What's up?
   * The new play's in town! 🌟 The old one's probably expired, so don't chase it like a runaway ghost. 👻 Remember, fresh data means fresh plays.
* Where are the crayons? I see words, not treats. 🧐
   * Click the links, Scoob! 😉
* Have I tested this mystery machine? 
   * Yeah! We've got a moderately rockin' Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate (7% wiggle room). 🤘
* What's the historical performance, Scooby-Doo?
   * A rad Sharpe Ratio of 1.85 and a groovy 68% win rate! There's a 95% chance our expected win rate dances between 63% and 75% (Stats as of 2023-03-31).

OG DD I posted three days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127wb3f/amc\_stock\_faces\_triple\_threat\_conversion\_reverse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/127wb3f/amc_stock_faces_triple_threat_conversion_reverse/)

I had no idea they were in Litigation, which involves \*certain\* shareholders suing AMC Entertainment for allegedly breaching its fiduciary duties to shareholders in connection with a stock offering that diluted the value of existing shares. As part of the settlement agreement, AMC has agreed to increase the number of authorized shares of its Class A common stock and conduct a reverse stock split to allow the conversion of preferred equity units into shares of Class A common stock. In order to settle the lawsuit, AMC has agreed to make a payment to the plaintiffs' class in the form of Class A common stock, subject to court approval. The number of shares to be paid will depend on the number of shares owned by the plaintiffs' class, and no fractional shares will be issued.

The exact number of shares to be given as part of the settlement payment will depend on the number of shares owned by the plaintiffs' class at the time of the settlement. However, based on the information provided in the settlement term sheet, if the Reverse Stock Split and Conversion go ahead, and the settlement is approved, the settlement payment will consist of one share of Class A common stock for every 7.5 shares of Class A common stock owned by the record holders of the Class A common stock as of the Settlement Class Time. As of March 31, 2023, the plaintiffs' class held 51,919,239 shares of Class A common stock. Therefore, an aggregate of 6,922,566 shares of Class A common stock would be issued in the settlement payment, representing approximately 4.4% of the outstanding Class A common stock on a pro forma basis.

4.4% dillution already.

Basically, some fund sued AMC for doing a reach around dillution and won \~$27 million dollars. Lmfao. Apes all got screwed but the plaintiff gets money??? I can't man this is too funny.

12apn9x,DD,Metro Community Bank is the FDIC's next victim.,"Before reading this, just look at the tickers chart the past month.

Metro Community Bank is facing significant financial challenges as 64% of its commercial real estate (CRE) loans need refinancing within the next 1-5 years, with 25% needing refinancing within one year. The bank's balance sheet is heavily reliant on these CRE loans, which may pose a risk to the bank's financial stability if the CRE problems continue to unfold.

In addition, Metro is facing regulatory and AML risks related to its use of prepaid debit cards to lend to commercial real estate and its relationship with Crypt0.Com, which has been implicated in money laundering for organized crime in Europe. The bank's reliance on volatile fintech and crypt0 deposits further complicates its financial situation.

If deposit outflows continue at Metro, the bank may face liquidity issues as it has a significant amount of its assets tied up in illiquid CRE loans. The bank's ability to post securities to the Fed under the BTFP may be limited as it only holds $958mn in securities that it could post. Additionally, the bank has a high percentage of uninsured deposits, which may make depositors hesitant to keep their funds with the bank.

Just like other banks who are now bust, Metro announced via press release that they are ""well capitalized"" not once, but twice... in just two weeks time. One on 3/14 (which has been deleted from their website's press releases) and the other on 3/30.

3/14 deleted press release:

Jamie Dimon and JPMega also totally do press releases so often to ensure the bank is liquid. Nothing to see here. Just remember guys, solvent companies have to issue press releases or do a media tour telling investors they are solvent.

Oh ya, 40% of their deposits are uninsured.

12aph3y,DD,NVO has majority market share for obesity care which has TAM 50x from current market. Why are calls so cheap ? 20k YOLO inside,"I'm gonna keep this short and simple with a lot of pictures coz I think this is a good opportunity to make money so gather around.

It's been well documented how [life expectancy](https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2020/01/extreme-obesity-shaves-years-off-life-expectancy) drops dramatically with obesity. GLP-1 drugs, used for some time in [diabetes](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/tablets-and-medication/incretin-mimetics) treatment, have recently been approved [in the US](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014) for obesity care. Do your own DD but this really seems like the silver bullet to obesity that drug companies have been looking for. Side effects include severe nausea and, rarely, pancreatitis and thyroid cancer, but this drug is extremely [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9063254/) at delivering weight loss.

NVO currently has over 50% market share from obesity care fwiw

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I really don't know what a fair value for these leaps is, but I think at least 5X up from here. At some point market is going to start pricing NVO closer to TAM valuation of 50X their obesity care, which at 9% current business implies a 450% growth from here. Their current p/e of 44 is high, but unlike NVDA, TSLA, and all the other nosebleed valuations which are predicated on hopes and dreams, this drug is real and it is only a matter of scaling it up.

First, let's discuss the BTFP loans. The FED is essentially playing Sugar Daddy to the banks, injecting copious amounts of cash to keep them afloat amidst any panic.

Now, allow me to illuminate the magical world of yield curve control. Our queen Yellen has been masterfully manipulating interest rates to maintain stability in the financial market. It's as if she possesses the Midas touch, turning everything she graces into gold.

These factors in mind, I'm inclined to place a Pascal's Wager on a rebound in the regional bank sector before I'd bet on the collapse of the US Markets.

129js4w,DD,The next AI stock to moon ($FDS),"**TL:DR;** FDS provides financial info like Bloomberg. Bloomberg recently announced their [own AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). AI only goes up.

FactSet (FDS) is well-positioned to take advantage of the current AI hype in the financial data analysis space. With over [96 APIs](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog) in their catalog, FDS has a vast array of data and services that could be enhanced by partnering with an AI language model like ChatGPT. Moreover, FDS has already made strides in natural language processing (NLP) with their [Factset Query Language](https://go.factset.com/hubfs/Website_Downloads/Statistical%20Package%20Integration/Docs%203.0/TipsandTechniques.pdf) (FQL), which allows users to make natural language queries to financial data. However, FDS could further improve their NLP capabilities by leveraging the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) which Bloomberg has recently done with [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). This could enable FDS to develop more sophisticated natural language interfaces and improve the accuracy and speed of financial data analysis. Additionally, FDS has a strong reputation in the financial data space and is one of the few publicly traded companies that provide financial data, making it an attractive partner for AI language models and financial institutions looking for reliable data sources.

FDS hasn’t confirmed that they’re using LLMs yet, but they probably are given that they mention GPT in a [job posting](https://factset.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/FactSetCareers/details/Machine-Learning-Engineer_R13291?q=GPT&__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=5bad2784-dc05-40fe-a68d-fee1a12cdc9b%7C397e76f1-32f7-4fbf-bd20-d38c0c14c7a9). They also have several blog posts on ChatGPT [as](https://insight.factset.com/chatgpt-and-decarbonizing-the-railroads) [well](https://insight.factset.com/understanding-chatgpt-the-promise-and-nuances-of-large-language-models).

FDS can leverage its [96 APIs](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog) in their catalog in a similar way to WolframAlpha’s collaboration with OpenAI. If they hook it up with ChatGPT or something similar, it can use these APIs to do financial analysis just like how [WolframAlpha enables ChatGPT to do math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOQV9VakBgE). It also allows the user to provide a query in natural language instead of needing to know how to code/read the API.

Just like the Bloomberg Query Language, FDS has Factset Query Language (FQL). FQL allows making interaction with financial data to be more natural. For example, “Show me companies with sales greater than the average sales of companies in the S&P 500.” would translate to “FF_SALES(ANN,0)>UAVG(FG_CONSTITUENTS(SP50,0,CLOSE),FF_SALES(ANN,0))”. This feature allows users to ask queries in plain language without needing to write complex code or have extensive knowledge of financial terms.

One thing to worry about is AI “hallucinations” in which the AI provides inaccurate information which would obviously be bad for financial analysts. There are two types of hallucinations: open-domain, and closed-domain. Closed-domain hallucinations refer to situations where the AI makes something up, but the information was already in its context. A good example of this is asking ChatGPT to summarize something, but it provides an extra detail that was never given. Research shows good progress on reducing closed-domain hallucinations via [clever prompting and reward model training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf). If you watch the WolframAlpha demo, they mention working with OpenAI to create a special version of GPT4, and it shows since it is reliably using WolframAlpha’s output. The same techniques can be done for FDS’s APIs to reduce inaccuracies.

Just like every other AI stock that has gone up by an absurd amount, once FDS announces usage of ChatGPT, it’s going to moon. Some of the AI stocks are just regarded and don’t make any sense, but FDS is a legit use-case, so it has long term prospects as well.",youve_been_gnomed,26,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,2023-04-02T12:26:04Z,Edited,False,t2_1mw2n14g,12,106,2,2,2018-06-24T07:49:02Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/129js4w/the_next_ai_stock_to_moon_fds/

128zgsd,DD,High Dividend Stock -MPW,"MPW stock dropped 62% in the past year, and yield 14% dividend for now.

Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (MPW) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in healthcare properties. The company owns a portfolio of over 100 hospitals and clinics in the United States and Europe.

Bulls

1. MPW is a well-managed company with a strong portfolio of healthcare properties. The company is likely to continue to grow in the long term, and its stock is likely to remain attractive to investors.
2. Healthcare sector performance: The healthcare sector has been one of the best-performing sectors in the stock market in recent years. This is due to a number of factors, including the aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, and the rising cost of healthcare.
3. MPW's acquisition strategy: MPW has a history of acquiring healthcare properties. The company has acquired over $10 billion in healthcare properties in the past five years. This acquisition strategy has helped MPW to grow its portfolio and to become one of the largest REITs in the healthcare sector.

Bears

1. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changes in government policies, which could create uncertainty for MPW's business.
2. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry, which could negatively affect MPW's financial performance.
3. MPW has a significant amount of debt, which could limit its ability to invest in new properties or pay dividends.",Gofighting777,27,0.62,10,0,0,10,0,2023-04-01T21:28:30Z,Edited,False,t2_60v7943l,129,11,5,1,2020-06-10T15:24:20Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/128zgsd/high_dividend_stock_mpw/

127wb3f,DD,"AMC Stock Faces Triple Threat: Conversion, Reverse Split, and Dilution","Common stock is trading at \~$4.92 per share, with a market capitalization of \~$2.55 billion, while the preferred stock was trading at $1.47 per share, with a market capitalization of \~$762 million. Following the conversion, the total number of common shares outstanding will increase to 1,280,104,754 shares. The new common shares will be valued equally with the existing common shares (whether converted or not), and the preferred shares will be converted on a one-to-one basis.

In addition to the conversion, the company has also announced a 10 for 1 reverse stock split, which is often seen as a last-ditch effort to boost a struggling stock.

Furthermore, AMC's preferred stock (APE) gives the company the ability to dilute, and the company already completed an offering of 43 million shares. This could further depress the stock price, as it will increase the total number of shares outstanding, potentially diluting the value of existing shares.

Today, someone placed a $1 million dollar bet on puts with a strike price of $2, as well as another $1 millon+ on puts for the $3 strike on the same date.

After the reverse split, these contracts will turn into $20 and $30 strike prices. This gambler expects amc to be below $20 and given all this negative shit that is about to happen, I think he is right.

It gets complicated with the conversion, but I think the stock will be trading around $12 after all of these things occur.

## 🖍️ Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Are Finger-Lickin' Good

Gawrsh, folks! Let's talk about how we can predict the tastiest crayon colors using some fancy-shmancy technical analysis and indicator-based trading. 📈🌈

You see, we're gonna use the current option open interest to calculate some big ol' numbers called portfolio-level greeks, like Delta and Gamma. Then we'll simulate how these greeks change at different price points, and find the levels where the gamma is the highest and the delta is close to 0. 📊

Sometimes, the price of our crayons reacts strongly to these levels, and that's what we'll use to drive our trading signals. 📡

Now, the plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which helps us figure out the expected size and duration of the reactions. Most of these plays are profitable, but the best ones benefit from the directional move and the increase in IV. 🎯

## 📝 Notes - Wrinkles and All
If the price has moved past the entry price, be careful! Make sure to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest. I usually risk up to 1% of my total capital on trades, but if I'm less confident, I'll allocate less and dollar cost average in. And remember, the trades are based on info up to yesterday, so new price movements might change the whole game. 🔄

## ❓ FAQ - 'Cause Y'all Keep Askin'
**Q:** Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? 🐻\
**A:** Nope! It just so happens that the companies are overextended, so these trades are mean-reverting.

**Q:** Are you entering all these plays? 🤔\
**A:** No siree! I'm just sharin' more plays with a probable edge to help you apes find more gain porn. 🦍💰

**Q:** What if you mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past? 🎢\
**A:** The new play should replace the old one. Don't chase the price, and remember that new data changes things.

**Q:** Where are the crayons? I only see words. 🖍️\
**A:** Click the links above, partner!

**Q:** Have you back-tested this? 🧪\
**A:** Yup! Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate (±7% margin of error).

**Q:** What's the historical performance? 📜\
**A:** The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28) 📅

So, folks, that's the scoop on how we can find the tastiest crayons in the box! Now go out there, do your own research, and get that gain porn! 🚀🌕",hardyrekshin,10,0.83,18,0,0,18,0,2023-03-30T23:51:45Z,False,False,t2_icqm0,374,3896,125,2776,2014-09-11T17:23:34Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1273kcm/20230331_wrinkle_brain_plays_in_the_style_of_goofy/
1273jda,DD,Went long QQQ calls today. I feel very dirty.,"I had to hold my nose and buy some QQQ calls.  The world cental banks injected $1 Trillion in liquidity and if I have learned something over the decades of trading, do not fight the Fed.  While I am confidant that the world is not saved, as is evident from my CRE post, I also remember 2008 when Bear Stearns went belly up in March but it took the summer and part of the Fall until Lehman went under.  Of course, the DOJ also sued two of Bear's hedge funds in August so that helped.  The chance of the DOJ suing any investment bank or bank this time around is 1%.  I mean, they just backstopped them, again.

**Other contributing factors to my QQQ long position:**

1. Hedge Funds and CTA's are still overwhelmingly bearish according to multiple reports from Government Sachs, the devil (JPM) and others.
2. QQQ is in a technical bull market now.  I don't argue with charts.
3. There's still that $1 trillion I mentioned up above that is supposed to stabilize deposit bases.  And after 2008 the largest banks who received their bailouts, promised to lend that money out.  They didn't - they put it in risk assets - stocks.  But sure, this time they will do as they say.
4. Hedgies are short overwhelmingly, to the tune of $28 billion SPX futures that they need to cover in April.
5. Seasonality as shown by the attached graphic.
6. Perfect conditions for a short squeeze on the NDX which is nowhere near overbought.

**HOWEVER, there are just as many worrisome data points:**

1. Since Dec 28, 50% of the gain in NDX has been from 5 stocks NVDA, AAPL, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA META.  Sorry, that's very.  See #2
2. From the graphic, earnings are now expected to drop 12% yoy from last year.  Not good if you are a fundamental investor.
3. There WILL be more bad news from the banking sector.  Might be a private HF or private REIT, but this is a no brainer.
4. The Fed apparently only really wanted to get the market through the end of this quarter bc how much news have you heard from them about regulatory enforcement?  NONE.  Why? Because if they hadn't, can you freaking imagine what some of these large banks would be reporting.
5. EOQ is the time for mutual funds and all to ""paint the tape.""  They sell the stocks that have rec'd bad press (banks) and buy the stocks that have rec'd good press (NVDA et al.)  Translation: HF chasing over the last 3 weeks has led to the NDX advance which has held the SPX up.
6. If the tech sector is so hot, then why have so many LARGE layoffs been announced?  And the layoffs are broad: META  -11,000; GOOGL - 12,0000; AMZN-distribution labor - 9000; Indeed - 2200 - uhm, job search site, WMT-layoffs from warehouse to distribution.  And then the one I think is hilarious are the 1400 from McKinsey and Co -who are usually the ones doing the layoffs.

BTW, perhaps the easiest metric to use to know if the NDX run is over?  AAPL.  Pull up a chart.  Lately its been leading the market.

Finally, despite being ""forced"" into a long QQQ position, I also put on a long VIX position today.  I mean, cmon - look at the daily chart.

I hate it, I think its a joke, but I will not fight the Fed.  I hope the market elevates so I can get short at higher levels. I remain short CMBS, COIN, and CLX.  Long VIX and other ""story"" plays.

Thanks.

Sounds like they have some great news to share. https://ir.usbank.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-bancorp-updates-schedule-earnings-conference-calls-0

Another important announcement is that shareholders of record by the close of the market tomorrow will be paid the quarterly dividend. https://ir.usbank.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-bancorp-announces-quarterly-dividends-48

I expect the dividend yield and ~~EPS~~ P/E to significantly outperform expectations because the shares have lost so much value in the last few weeks.

$USB has been oversold in my opinion, it seemed to by lumped in with the regional bank panic, even though its the 5th largest bank in the US. 

I think the share price will jump tomorrow, I’m going to buy 0DTE calls at open.

126h6cj,DD,[DD] 😱 Google Panicking Puts itself in Catastrophic Position 📉💥,"Ladies and gentlemen, why\_is\_not\_real here with some juicy intel on Google ($GOOGL) and its ongoing AI drama. Buckle up because this DD will reveal why Google is trembling in the face of OpenAI, losing top talent, and dealing with Bard's epic failure.

&#x200B;

🤖 Bard, the Failing Chatbot 🤖

First, let's talk about Bard, Google's chatbot. It's become clear that nobody is adopting this disaster of an AI, and it has consistently failed in every public demonstration. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, and the internet is feasting on the carnage.

In contrast **ChatGPT, barely in it's early infancy, is already the fastest growing internet application in the history of humanity** ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/))

&#x200B;

🔥 Desperation & Controversy 🔥

Just a few hours ago, The Verge published an article ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies)) detailing some damning allegations. The Information reported that a former Google AI researcher accused the company of using ChatGPT data (a rival's responses) to train Bard. Google denies it, but when asked directly, Bard fessed up ([https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20](https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20)).

The plot thickens. Jacob Devlin, a Google AI engineer, warned the company not to use ChatGPT data because it would violate OpenAI's terms of service and make Bard's answers look suspiciously similar. Google supposedly stopped using the data after his warnings, but who can trust them at this point?

Devlin then jumped ship, leaving Google to join OpenAI immediately. That's right, folks – we're seeing top talent abandon Google in droves, and it's only the beginning.

&#x200B;

👀 Why is this big? 🤔

**It's illegal for Google to use ChatGPT's data to train their AI**. There might be a lawsuit coming their way soon. If **OpenAI can get an injunction on Google Bard or any other of their AI technologies** based on this engineer's testimony, it's be game over for Google.

Careful though, I wouldn't bet on OpenAI either. Any company that tries to be ""the owner of AI"" is doomed to fail. AI is quickly becoming an open technology.

People are already running AI almost as powerful as GPT directly on their phones with open models ([https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20)). Also on their computers ([https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71](https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71)).

New, faster, better, more portable models are coming out every day (this came out just a few days and its 100x faster to train than GPT: [https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)). Additionally, most of the innovation is coming out of small groups, independent researchers and tech enthusiasts at home. It's like the early days of home computing all over again.

&#x200B;

🚨 Panic in Google-land 🚨

Rumors are swirling that Google employees are calling for Sundar Pichai to be replaced ASAP. The company is in full-blown panic mode, and their desperation is becoming more apparent with each passing day ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1))

A lot of the leadership of the most innovative programs are leaving Google ([https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3)). Like the head of VR who left to start his own AI company ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor))

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

Google is on the ropes, and Bard's failures are just the tip of the iceberg. They're losing top talent to OpenAI, facing damning allegations, and their once-untouchable reputation is crumbling. The market will eventually catch up to these realities, and it's time for us to keep our eyes on the prize.

## 🦕 Yabba Dabba Doo! - Why These Crayons Are Dino-mite! 🖍️

Hey there, cave dwellers! Gather 'round the ol' stone tablet, 'cause I've got a rock-solid trading plan that'll have you rolling in clams faster than a Brontosaurus burger! 🍔

You see, we're gonna use some fancy schmancy techniques like technical analysis and indicator-based trading to predict prices that'll make the Bedrock Stock Exchange go wild! 📈

We'll start by peeking at the current option open interest and crunchin' some numbers to calculate those mysterious greeks, Delta and Gamma. Then, we'll simulate changes in greeks at different price points to find the sweet spots where our portfolio goes ""Yabba Dabba Doo!"" 🎯

Now, some tickers react like a cat on a hot tin roof when they hit delta neutral, gamma max, or both. We'll use those reactions to drive our trading signals, like a modern stone-age family! 🚗

Our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that's as reliable as ol' Dino. We'll profit from both the directional moves and the increase in IV. It's like hitting two birds with one stone! 🐦🪨

## 📜 Notes from the Flintstone Files 📜

If the price has moved past the entry price, don't go chasin' it like a saber-toothed squirrel! Something changed, so be cautious. Sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest. Remember, I'm no financial advisor, just a caveman with a knack for trading. Allocate your capital wisely and don't forget to dollar cost average in. 🌰

## ❓ FAQ - Because Barney Keeps Asking the Same Questions ❓

* **These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?** No, I'm a straight-up caveman! These trades are just mean-reversion plays, so don't worry about labels.
* **Are you entering all these plays?** Nope! I'm just sharing some prehistoric wisdom to help you apes find more gain porn. 🦍💰
* **You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?** The new play replaces the old one. Don't chase the price like a woolly mammoth on the loose! 🐘
* **Where are the crayons? I only see words.** Click the links above, my fellow cave dweller! 🖍️
* **Have you back-tested this?** You bet your saber-toothed tiger I have! Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error). 📊

So, there you have it, folks! A prehistoric trading plan that'll have you living like a king in Bedrock!

1260s7q,DD,Commercial Office REITS Pop after Selloff [SLG],"SL Green is a commercial office REIT which holds interest in 61 buildings comprising 33.1m NRSF (net rentable square feet) with 28.9m NRSF in Manhattan. In the weeks following SVB’s collapse, the stock tumbled ~45%. This was the most battered CREIT stock for good reason:

-The Manhattan office market remains near an abysmal ~50% occupancy level.

-Famed short seller Jim Chanos short portfolio comprises a significant SLG short position (TSLA, AMC, and COIN are his other large positions). He has publicly shat on the stock on the finance Disney channel (CNBC).

-The implied cap rates (according to Chanos) on their properties are ~5%, a nonsensical number relative to the risk of these properties and uncertainty surrounding future NOIs.

-The uncertainty surrounding the NYC property market is at an all-time high as large tenants leave Manhattan for lower rents in locales with more stable workforces and less affordability issues.

-CREIT’s continue to face interest rate risk as they rollover existing debt from the free money era to significantly higher rates.

Nonetheless, the stock has rebounded ~10% this week. It appears that many of the short sellers are taking profits before earnings are reported on 4/19. Earnings are sure to be brutal but, there is good reason to assume that pessimism peaked last week. The banking crisis has proven (for now) to be manageable and, in spite of the very valid long-term doubts about the Manhattan office market, it remains a vital center of commerce in the US. I agree with the short sellers theses on SLG but, they may be in pain if the macro environment remains (relatively) stable over the next few weeks. The stock is still ~50% off of its pre SVB price of $35.06 which is well below its 2022 high of $83.96.",old_shows,35,0.8,14,0,0,14,0,2023-03-29T21:08:42Z,False,False,t2_luz7177y,14,171,1,16,2022-05-13T03:54:24Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1260s7q/commercial_office_reits_pop_after_selloff_slg/
125zv08,DD,The Road to 405 SPY/ 4095 ES… 3-29-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,"As I have been saying since pretty much Friday we have been left with some very low volume and incredibly tight intraday ranges. As you can see below this is our longest streak of less than 1% moves in over a year. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uc3oxrmrnqqa1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5170b749c79bd7e551c699141fa31c9319efd1d

Watching price action again we are left with significant overnight ranges and from open till about power hour we consolidate in a tight range before we finally break out. I for one can not really remember a time when we have had <$2 intraday range from 930a to 3pm and then had that range nearly doubled during power hour. Its very interesting watching these tight ranges. 

It almost feels like there is not enough actual intraday buying going on then EOD all the calls/ puts OI is coming off the books and causing a huge move. Actually one of the most impressive things about today is that for most of the day our S&p500 breadth was 20:1+ which is actually a very strong buy pressure…. Despite that we actually showed a ton of intraday weakness until the EOD when we finally had a rally basically from 230 till EOD. 

Tech as a whole today had a very generously green day with Amazon putting in a huge 3.1% green day. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5mkqj74snqqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=887edaf792e11acb66cef3618c05481a31da852e

We as far as I was concerned had no true direction yesterday but with the reversal doji on spy I did favor upside potential. However, today markets chose the bullish side of things.

One of the strongest things that can happen is when a supply is turned into demand or demand is turend into supply. Today we actually have the bulls turning that 395.8 supply into a demand at 395.56 (support). With this we are now on the move to put in a new supply. With this new demand (support) it also opens up the potential to test previous supplies.

Since we gapped over and tested 399.07 supply and turned that into support our upside target should be 405.17 supply (resistance) here. 

I see really two scenarios here… first is we push to 405.2 and reconfirm that as supply or put in a slightly higher suppy closer to 407 before we see a bigger retrace to take our 405.2 and 399.07 supply. The second scenario is that we see a pretty big red day tomorrow to establish a new supply (resistance) at 401.3. IF we do that then we should come down to take out 399.07 supply and I would target a retest of 395.56 and 393.07 demands. We either reconfirm one of those as demand (support) or attempt to establish a new demand somewhere near 390. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kf8xedksnqqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15c8f2eb8deef8d690c386287bde7f9bc0020e76

Bulls from a price action stand point actually put in a pretty strong day today. We finally broke out of the 391.8 to 399 consolidation channel and actually turned 399 into support as of now. We also finally saw a turn breakout of the breakout/down triangle. 

From a bullish stand point with a breakout of consolidation, the breakout triangle, a closure over the daily 200 ema and a 8/20ema bullish crossover are target here should remain 405.2. Since we reconfirmed 390 as support for this purple channel our next logical expectation is 405.2 resistance retest. 

On a bearish stand point we have a potential abandoned baby pattern formed here… not this is a very rarely played out pattern but it’s a fun one to watch… for this to play out we need a pretty good sized red pre market/ open. 

Realistically from a price action and supply/ demand stand point here I see a path to retest 405.2 tomorrow and then knowning the historics of the JPM collar day I would not be surprised to see us put in a pretty good sized red day Friday with a red open too (will cover that more tomorrow night). This is our fourth day in a row of very tight $3-4 range days… we are overdue for a big trend day. 

SPY Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 399.1 -> 405.2

On futures here we did not turn supply into demand but we did establish a new demand (support) at 4005. 

With that and now the potential to close over key 4055 supply (resistance) our target here on futures should be to push to 4095 and take out that demand. If and when we take out that demand we actually have a potential to turn that into supply (resistance)… that would open up a potential for a retrace all the way back to 4015 to take out those supplies. This tends to be the trajectory that I believe we are working under… I do forsee a potential where we could put in a new supply (resistance) before we get to 4095 though.

Much like here on SPY we broke through the breakout triangle and today we once again confirmed the daily 8ema as support. We are actually about to see a daily 8ema crossover the daily 200ema also. 

With this closure over 4055 we should look for a push to the next major resistance area which is 4085 to 4095. 

If we close over 4095 there is realistically a case where we could breakout back to 4160 area but more probably we will reject at or near 4095 and come back down to test the daily 200ema near 4000. 

Much like SPY my base case here is an upside push to 4095 followed by a retrace back to 4015. 

Futures Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 4015 -> 4040 -> 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand- 4095 -> 4005  
 Support- 4055 -> 4040 -> 4015 -> 4000  
 Resistance- 4065 -> 4085 -> 4095

The VIX had another good sized drop today but one thing to note is that the VIX did leave a pretty good sized gap from 19.91 to 19.45… The VIX of all the tickers ive ever watched is one that does not like to leave a gap unfilled for too long. 

I am seeing this set up pretty perfectly for a big drop on the VIX tomorrow to 18.2 with SPY hitting 405.2 and futures hitting that 4095 area… Followed by a very red open Friday and potentially red day Friday too.

Today ended up being a good day… I got a second chance to close out my 396calls I have been holding (was busy Monday and missed my 399 closure at open). I got greedy on both my 5dte plays and didn’t take 3-4% gains on both expecting some sort of continuation only to get completely chopped up. These tight range days are very tough to trade as everything looks beautiful for contiuation and then you are left with a reversal. Not only that but when the total intraday range 3 hours in is barely $1.5 premiums just don’t pay enough. 

I ended up switching to some scalping today and had some very high success with that to recover some profits. I do plan when we see these tight range days plan to drop my dte and play some quick hit scalps. I actually forgot how fun it was to scalp as I havent done true scalps since about december. I don’t forsee myself going back to 0dte anytime soon as premiums still are funky enough to not warrant it but I did enjoy some of these lower dte scalps.

## 🖍️ A Tantalizing Treatise on Tastier Crayons 🎨

Welcome to the dark side, my friends, where we feast on crayons and dabble in the mysterious world of technical analysis. But fear not, I shall guide you through this twisted realm with wit and charm (or at least a morbid sense of humor). 🦇

In our quest for crayon delicacies, we examine past price performances and use option open interest to calculate the elusive Delta and Gamma. With these ghoulish greeks in hand, we can simulate changes at different price points and pinpoint the most delectable levels. 😋

You see, some tickers react strongly to delta neutral, gamma max, and occasionally both. It's these reactions that fuel our trading signals and guide us to the most scrumptious crayons. 🌈

Our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which considers the expected size and duration of the reaction. The best plays are akin to a delightful dance between directional moves and increased IV. 💃

## 📜 Notes from the Crypt 💀
- Beware if the price has moved past the entry point. Proceed with caution, for something wicked this way comes.
- Sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest, like a game of Russian roulette. 🔫
- Risk up to 1% of your capital, or less if your conviction is weak. Dollar cost average in, like a vampire sipping blood. 🧛
- Trades were calculated before market open, so keep in mind that new price movement may invalidate our original thesis.

12542bo,DD,Low volume and tight ranges… 3-28-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,"Well this is now our second day in a row with very low volume (compared to the 30day average) and very low intraday range (compared to the 10 day average). Right now it would appear that the markets are sitting and waiting for something…. The question is what are they waiting for? 

The only really big things that I see right now on the agenda is GDP Thursday and PCE Friday… I don’t forsee either of those as enough to keep market on edge. However, one thing to note again today is that the NYSE breadth was fairly green while SPY/ NASD had red breadth most of the day. Tech for the second day in a row was the laggard.

I mentioned yesterday that when we establish a new supply and then immediately push over it or establish a supply below current price action then we are looking at an imbalance in the markets and that we should look for the to rectify before we get a true direction. 

Today we presumably started that rebalancing and correction. What I see now is that we actually bounced off of and turned the 395.82 supply back into a proper resistance. 

Now this opens up two scenarios… first is an opportunity to continue to push higher with a green day tomorrow which could potentially turn this 395.82 supply into demand (support). If bulls are able to do that then that would be extremely bullish and would open up a retest of 399.07 supply (resistance) and possibly 405.17 supply.

Scenario two would be the bearish case where 395.82 become a proper supply (resistance) which would lead to a downside push to 393.07 demand (support) or 385.87 demand (support). 

We should know by tomorrow when our daily candle closes which scenario we are getting. I personally am still bullish and still favor an upside push back to 399.07 and eventually 405.17.

The daily continues to consolidate within this breakout/down triangle. 

On a bullish side of things we retest daily 8ema support and managed to close once again over the daily 20ema. In addition the daily candle structure is a bullish reversal doji (morning doji star) pattern which should lead to an upside push back to 399. 

On a bearish side of things after yesterdays rejection at 399 we have now found the daily 50ema as resistance and after wicking below the daily 8ema could be looking to close below it tomorrow. 

The biggest thing I see here so far on the daily is that we are sitting between this 391.8 to 399 black consolidation channel and really haven’t made a decision one way or another which way we are going to go yet. 

Key breakout triangle support is at 392.3 and resistance at 400.1 tomorrow. With back to back tight range days and low volume days I would not be surprised to see a trend day and a bigger overall movement tomorrow. 

SPY Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 395.8 -> 399.1 -> 405.2  
 Demand- 393.1 -> 398.9  
 Support- 393 -> 391.8 -> 390.1  
 Resistance- 395.8 -> 398.2 -> 399

We have been waiting for the bears to put a new supply in on the daily chart and we finally got that today at 4015 as I was suspecting could happen if we didn’t push to 4040/4055 today. We now have the futures and SPY daily charts next in line to make a demand (support). 

With a new supply (resistance) at 4015 on futures that actually favor more of a bearish tone then that of SPY. With this 4015 supply we should actually expect a drop to demand (support) at 3972 and possibly 3945. 

Much like spy though we find ourselves directionless and with a lot of consolidation here.

I had mentioned the despite my bullishness that the futures daily chart actually was primed with that daily gravestone doji yesterday for a bearish reversal. We did end up getting that today and we came all the way back down to the daily 8 ema and bounce. 

On a bullish side of things here we were able to confirm the daily 8ema, 20, 50 and 100ema as support with the bounce today. We also were able to turn 4001 into support which was resistance last week. 

However, on a bearish side of things here we actually have a really nice bearish engulfing daily candle and what could be perceived as a failure for bulls to breakout over the daily 200ema once again. 

This is where once again we find ourselves in a consolidation range before the bigger move likely happens. The bulls best scenario here is to turn 4001 into a double bottom and close minimally over 4015 tomorrow which could open up a push to 4040/4055 Thursday. The bears would ideally like to see a continuation tomorrow and attempt to close under the blue support line at 3972 which is also our demand (support). 

Futures Daily levels:  
 Supply- 4015 -> 4040 -> 4055  
 Demand- 3972 -> 3945   
 Support- 4001 -> 3990 -> 3972  
 Resistance- 4015 -> 4040

Interestingly enough we had a red vix and red spy closure today which is not always the common case. We actually held that 20.5 support line I mentioned for a lot of the morning before we had seen a pretty sizable push up on the VIX only to EOD see it sell off once again. 

The VIX once again had a ton of movement today, however, in the end it chose to continue to unwind. We now near 19.67 support which is a big pivot level to keep and eye on for tomorrow.

Not too bad of a trading day in the end but this tight range and choppiness definitely got the best of me mid day. Had a great start to the morning and end up giving back quite a bit of those gains. I ended up getting greedy on two of those plays and could have closed them for green at some point. I also mid day found myself on the wrong side of the trend as I was bullish while the chart clearly wanted to be bearish.

124sy7i,DD,Behemoth v2: NIO,"Hey guys

Back at it with another DD.  Going to keep it short and hopefully it help somebody, had many people pm last time thanking me for last one.  Hope i am right on this one.


I'm sure everyone read the news on BABA and how Jack Ma is finally back in China and BABA is to be split into 6 to promote competitiveness.  This in itself is very significant, because the Chinese government has a big change top down and this further shows that they are trying to open up their economy instead of isolating themselves like the past decade especially the past few years.  I firmly believe the next big plays are for Chinese stocks, and it should be in every portfolio as a hedge because their valuation are cheap, and the banking system is heavily regulated so it is not as prone to banking crisis.  China's central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for financial institutions by 0.25 percentage points yesterday to boost liquidity.  That means more money and is in a way QE because it boost the real economy and eventually lead to more spending.  More spending means more EV and better business environment.  On the other hand, US stocks are getting battered, crypto the safe heaven is getting ""regulated"" or whatever you want to call it.   Out of the chinese stocks, I believe the best one to long would be NIO without a doubt.

Pros:

- Chinese EVs like NIO are extremely cheap and battered due to the Tesla price cuts and it poses such a big opportunity

- Record deliveries, expect to double sales this year

- 1000 new battery swap stations, there is nothing like it of this scale anywhere in the world.  It's really that good, and convenient.  Huge selling point. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTXptUuKGrc

- On track to break even next year, this is huge, remember when Tesla finally broke even?   https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-maker-nio-surges-says-022624895.html

- Have a huge fan base similar to Tesla, my family just bought an ES8 and they absolutely loves it 

- Delisting is behind us

- many many many more


Cons:

- Geopolitical tension

- Last earning was very bad, but this is where opportunities comes from right?  

- Some scandals with employees 

Guys this is a real company, no one will come close to Tesla but this one is as close as it gets IMO.  
Hope this help somebody as always, Good luck!

124cf1l,DD,SnP500 outlook DD NFA DYOR,"**Economic cycles**

Currently, the economy just burst a very large bubble, primarily led by tech and globalization. We saw tech stocks dominate for years, and then boom we ded. For context Sanic believes the fed has a playbook, its similar approaches to fiscal policy for similar situations, he also believes in cycles because hoomans are always the same, just reskinned to the newest pop culture trends. One must think, when was the last time something like this happened, well we can look back to the situation back in 1999-2003, where we had y2k and a rebound over the coming years which then crashed and led to slow growth up until 2008. Lets take a look at that situation.

&#x200B;

**1999-2003 Y2k tech stock emergence**

Back then investors were just throwing funds around hoping to hit the 10x gem that would retire them. Sounds a bit like VC funds nows.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gsajhszvneqa1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e0b8e7bb92bebaf390808c6cf91281e43404fa3c

This is the spx weekly chart back in late 90’s early 00’s. When we look at this we see a long run up into 2000, and the eventual crash known as y2k, but what we also see is that the spx was able to rebound over the coming years and retest its all time highs several years later. Y2K imo is earily similar to what we see now, just at a much slower pace, this can be attributed to increased market participants, rate of rate hike increases, when you watch a shit coin with no volume stagnate, its not because its dead, its taking longer to play out because noones playing. In this scenario it took the spx rougly 750 days to find the bottom, 960 days to form the higher low. The theory is that these events are playing out in real time at a speed of 2-3x back then.

&#x200B;

**SPX over the past few years BACK TO THE PRESENT**

Now lets take a look at now.

https://preview.redd.it/om7gi9pzneqa1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=729c7f2186152f2ae53a5d38f8d674eff719f2ed

This is the daily chart of the spx over the past few years, we see that if right, the bottom of the spx took 280 days to find, and 370 days to find the higher low, also the angle of decline in both situation on the scale im on are roughly 2x. meaning it makes sense we find a bottom faster than before because the decline is much sharper and quicker. so we get 370 days vs 960 in y2k. Well from here if we assume the same for the rebound we might be able to predict the next time for the top of the market as a whole before an eventual crash, we can do this by finding how many days it took for the spx to rebound after y2k and then dividing that number by 2-3.

&#x200B;

For the purpose of calculations I will be basing it off the date of when we found the higher low. Also just to add to the theory, the drop in y2k top to bottom was about 50% on the spx, the drop we went through was roughly 25%… wud u look at that 2-3x multiplier doing work loool.

&#x200B;

**When is the next top of the stock market and murican economy.**

So lets just run the calculations, 960/370= aprrox 2.6x. So lets see the HL to top days it took for the rebound after 03.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sey9no99oeqa1.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12c07ef5238b3f05567d52835dfab58be247bd15

It took 1659 days, lets divide that by 2.6 rough estimates which gives us about 638 days, now lets see where 638 days leads us to after the HL formed this year.

https://preview.redd.it/hj30a5idoeqa1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02a10817b75b69c4f0d2b71550c1a91d46c582fe

This leads us to sept/oct 2024. In sanics perspective, a long period of down is not in the books because most would prefer the economy goto shit briefly then boom, its hooman nature to rather live above means if it means living below means for some time, most do not want to live at avg sustainable means.

&#x200B;

**Now the supplementary to make it less of a crackhead theory.**

Well we gots to look at back then to see how rates were and compare them to now to understand the fed playbook. Sanic was sitting at home and heard some boomer french dude talking about how rates didnt work how they used to but are instead the inverse, decreasing rates were not helping the economy but instead were decreasing confidence in the markets

https://preview.redd.it/ztmbm7igoeqa1.png?width=1343&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=912cbe932e60c4952396d9ac269d506b92f1d52f

.Look at those pleb changes in rate hikes, powell blows them outta the water.

https://preview.redd.it/adqpkpyioeqa1.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cfd30fc1caeef083f05cda9809486c4dc2b2b00

Look at the speed of these hikes compared to back then, in a more sciency physics way, assuming absolute values on these numbers and including time, I wouldnt be surprised if the time under tension of these rates was = to back then, just because these rate hikes happened at a higher magnitude and at a faster rate, look at how fast we climbed in a year. All this happening 2-3x faster than before.

&#x200B;

**The Playbook**

Well it basically just comes down to new ideas not being new ideas, they use previous approaches and restructure them for new scenarios. What the fed did back then is going to rhyme with what theyre doing now. Alot of people clown powell but do you really think the dude with infinite information on us economic history isnt going to use it and is just going to act on impulse on what he wants to do? No. Assuming powell is an idiot is one of the worst calls imo, maybe some slight misteps along the way but his goal will always be for the bettering of america.

&#x200B;

**GO USA**

Im a canuck but alot of people think americas intentions are the most vile and disguisting possible, they may have negative actions but its still in their perspective to better the world, why would they want countries below them to get rekt. When your first place in a race you dont want everyone else in the race to quit because winning by default means nothing. Lets say the fed increases rates even more, we would start seeing other curriencies start to get rekt due to usd being what most debt is denominated in. The fed must ease to let the rest of the world breath. Globalization benefitted murica the most, u think they wanna rek the homies they profit from? America can basically cash in on the world right now by dropping and easing rates. Americans having a strong currency will be their biggest benefit, thats their upside for doing so. In a sense, america basically has to save the rest of the world at this point, were starting to see banks around the world start to fail.

&#x200B;

**ERHHH What about inflation?**

Well who was the largest part of the economy/controlled most of the wealth in the economy? The boomers. Well the boom started in 1946, the avg life expectancy in america is 77 years. 1946+77=2023. SO we know the big homies are about to start dropping, in my eyes this is similar to a token burn in crypto/tvl going up. The circulating supply of $ may have gone up, but how much of that will actually be circulating if the homies start dying? Not as much as one would think imo, helping aid in dropping “inflation”. Also getting rid of the strain these boomers have on the economy is probably what will fuel us in the coming years once all the bs is past us and we have stablized.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION TLDR**

Sanic thinks spx tops in q3 2024 maybe q2, what it means for crypto sanic does not know, but as a degen will only be a crypto boi. NFA sanic was high for the last time when this idea spawned in early dec 2022. Sanic thinks rates will avg out soon to a lower point, expecting a 0 rate hike or negative soon. Also for the calculations, sanic has another date if u instead use the ratio of finding the bottom vs finding the top and then applying said ratio to now, will add that in later today possibly.

First post was removed assuming cause no explanation. So essentially this theory is looking for previous precedants and rate hikes during and post y2k and how the economy reacted, I go through the eerie similarities and Ive gotten each rate hike pretty much right aside from the +50 we got 2 months ago, was expecting +25, anyways feel free to check it out and criticise it, if this gets traction or anyone wants the full doc with more confluence just sub and ill drop that. Overall everything seems to be playing out decently accurately and TLDR I think spx tops in q2-3 2024 and then we get a serious downturn from there. The banking situations and rate hikes have been making this theory more and more viable, concepted this early december, only released this side article earlier this month to have some work out before I leave the team.

## A Tantalizing Treatise on The Tastiest Crayons in Trade 🖍️

Once upon a midnight dreary, the market whispered, weak and weary,
Of technical analysis and indicators, oh so eerie,
To predict the price levels of today, based on the past,
A tale of options, greeks, and the stock market's vast.

In this macabre analysis of option open interest, we see,
Calculations of portfolio-level greeks, Delta and Gamma, with glee,
Simulating changes at different price points, as if by a ghostly hand,
Discovering where gamma is high, and delta near zero, like a raven in the sand.

Some tickers, like spirits in the night, react strongly, it's true,
Off delta neutral, gamma max, or both, a spectral brew,
It is these reactions from the past, that drive our trading signals,
Like a pendulum swinging, or the beating heart beneath the floorboards, it jiggles.

123zjdc,DD,3-27-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,"I was not able to do any trading today unfortunately but caught the end of the market today to see us close. Looks like we end up with a low volume and tight $3.36 range day today. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w074t8yhecqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ea0253d96b6aa73636b7ae21132d18568fb72bf0

Taking a look here at the supply and demand on the daily we actually put in a new supply (resistance) at 395.82. One thing to note much like the 3945 demand on futures from last week that this is a weaker supply than the other supplies like 399.07. 

So this is where much like a few weeks ago when we had supplies and demands “out of order” or that “didn’t make sense” we are seeing an imbalance here right now and basically seeing price action that doesn’t make a ton of sense just yet. 

With this supply (which technically since below price action is actually a support now) being established today we are now in the process of making a new demand (support) The question will be do we come back down to 393.07 demand (support) before we make a new demand…. Or more probable will we attempt to turn this 395.82 supply into a demand. The most probable scenario I see is attempting to turn this into demand which would be extremely bullish. 

However, as you can see today we nearly to the penny rejected that 399.07 level. That 399.07 area remains a very strong supply (resistance) that bulls need to breach still. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4js2ehgiecqa1.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac0d7f04be587ea9a4a64fdc46ed3c319d28dcab

The biggest things to note today from price action stand point is the fact that we turned the daily 20ema into support now. However, we also once again failed to breach the daily 200ema. The daily 200ema as you know is a major level and that many times takes numerous days of interaction to break through whether over or under. 

Bulls will look to continue to hold the daily 20ema as support and much like futures daily will look to get a daily 8/20ema bullish crossover. The last step for the bulls before a bigger run will happen is a closure over the daily 200ema at 399. If and when that happens my target will remain 405.2. However, if the bears can fight back and get us to close under the daily 20ema and most importantly under that key 395.8 supply (now support) then I would start to target 393 and possibly 390.1 support once again. 

SPY Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 395.8 -> 399.1 -> 405.2  
 Demand- 393.1 -> 385.9  
 Support- 396.4 -> 393.1 -> 391.9  
 Resistance- 398.2 -> 399 -> 401.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iqc11lgjecqa1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b9e9f79ee03220d829ab84934a69bc8fa6b233b

Now this is why I enjoy trading SPY but analyzing both futures and spy… when we look at the supply/ demand here we actually do not see a new supply being established yet on futures daily. However, there is a pretty interesting different here in the fact that SPY daily is approaching a new demand (support) being established but futures is closer to establishing a new supply (resistance). 

This is where things will be more interesting to watch play out this week. We did not quite reach the 4040/4055 supply (resistance) area on futures today. That was and remains my first upside target before a possible bigger run to 4095 this week. However, if we see a red day tomorrow we actually very well could establish 4013 as a new supply (resistance) which would open up a sell off down to 3972/ 3945 demand (supports). This is where we as I said have a discrepancy between spy and futures here. Eventually these will correlate and correct but for now we find ourselves directionless. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j52edbxjecqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=519a01b5d40eac2a856f0eda294df1309f97cb38

Now looking at daily futures price action here I actually have to favor a slight bearish bias compared to spy… what I am seeing here is that we closed out a gravestone doji with a rejection off the daily 200ema and we failed to get to 4040/4055 supply/ resistance. Now the one thing to keep in mind for the last 3 days now you can see we have had some pretty large wicks and all three days have closed out as dojis. 

SPY favors upside continuation tomorrow while futures daily I would say favors an upside top and breakdown to 3970 or potentially 3945 support. However, if we followed SPY daily upside then my target remains 4040/4055 and ultimately 4095. 

Futures Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 4040 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4095 -> 3972 -> 3945  
 Support- 4000 -> 3988 -> 3972 -> 3945  
 Resistance- 4014 -> 4040 -> 4055 -> 4085 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2edhm1ekecqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=041d883aa0c35c1c9970765d1beb3242e583b0ba

The VIX continues to also point to further upside and I actually am surprised to see such a small green day of only 0.19% on SPY with such a large 5.15% drop on the VIX. 

The VIX daily is now experiencing a bearish (bullish for markets) 8/20ema crossover and is attempting to break the support which sits at 20.5 for tomorrow. IF we break that support then my downside target is 19.68 and eventually 17.72 to 18.21 support area. 

I do not always follow the fear and greed index but it definitely should be noted we are in a “fear” market and were in an “extreme fear” market just last week. The risk is definitely to the upside versus the downside currently. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I was gone the majority of the day today and did not get to make any trades today. I do still have some 18dte 396 calls I am holding. I was not around at open which I could have sold them for about 15% looking back it appears. My upside target remains 405 for these and I wouldn’t mind an average down if we touched and bounced off 390.1 sometime early this week.

Blackstone ($BX):

* Revenues in 2021 were $22.57billion and dropped to $8.5 billion in 2022.  OUCH
* Worse, net interest income dropped from $461 million to NEGATIVE $105 million.
* Long term debt rose from $7.7 billion in 2021 to $12.3 billion in 2022 - I think BX is trying to borrow to buy itself time.
* BX does have access to about $187 billion in credit to bring to bear so its not like they will go out of business.  think of them as one of the Too Big To Fail CRE firms.
* BX runs an internal non traded $71 billion REIT - which they have halted withdrawals for 4 months and counting.
* Operating income dropped from $13 billion in 2021 to $4.9 billion in 2022.
* But the big data point for me is that over the last 6 months, **BX insiders sold 97.83% of BX stock.**  Now, a lot of this selling was from various BX limited partnerships which companies like BX use to hide the salami but still, that is a crap ton of selling.
* BX has a current PE of 35 and a forward PE of 13ish while the industry has a PE of 9
* BX has a PEG ratio (PE plus what earnings are expected to grow at) of 3.43 while the industry average is .73
* By these two metrics, BX is priced at a premium, probably due to the fact that they have some very smart people working for them.  But smart people cannot overcome negative momentum when it starts to affect things they cannot control.
* Finally, while they do have a nice 5% div, their payout ratio is 208%.
* So, falling revenues, falling asset performance, falling asset values, negative dividend coverage, insiders dumping. Not a good picture.

I do not think in anyway that BX is going out of business.  I do believe their recent defaults of $1 billion in CMBS, not straight mortgages, are just the tip of the iceberg.  The question is, how deep does it go?

For me, I believe that the CRE market dive is only starting.  If a rising tide raises all ships, the opposite occurs with a falling tide.

One last note: **BX earnings and revenue drops were BEFORE the last 2 months when CRE started feeling pain.  Just when they were recovering from Covid, Yellen's incompetence created a huge (imo) outlier risk.**

BX reports earnings soon so a surprise to the upside or the Fed announcing a cut could screw up my thesis but I think that BX will fall to $70 with a possibility for a flush to $60 my real target.  Thats -13 and -23 from the current price.

So, I am looking at SEPT 60-70 puts, haven't decided yet.  Projected return if BX falls to $60 would be 200%ish.  MY stop will be right above this months high, $92.50.  If that happens I will lose 60% on the premium.  So Reward to risk is 3.3X, not great but not bad (I usually look for 10X option plays on 20% moves) if BX falls to $60 by July 1.

DISCLAIMER: You are a grown ass person so if you decide this is a trade you like, it's on you.  I am not telling or recommending this to anyone.  And I am prepared to manage the position on spikes or dumps if need be - this is not to me a set and forget.

TLDR: BX is very over valued by traditional metrics, insiders have sold 97% of their stock, and I am taking a shot.

Thanks and I welcome intelligent comments.  Stupid comments not so much.

122w1ks,DD,AVAV — big boy drones for defense,"Aerovironment has been trading sideways since the Ukraine conflict kicked off. Their products (especially the Switchblade loitering munitions) are in heavy use by the US military, and have a superb track record with the Ukrainians. Expect to see further adoption + NATO standardization around their platforms or similar. Loitering munitions are single use, ensuring orders for years to come. Even with their healthy bump following the Ukraine invasion, I think the market is underestimating AVAV's future prospects + likelihood of acquisition by a giant defense contractor. There's meat on the bones still at $90.

Make no mistake—US and NATO militaries will not be using DJI Mavics with grenades for their small UAV / loitering munition needs. NATO will not tolerate a Chinese supply chain for their vehicles in a china-centric threat environment. They will use an American contractor. AVAV is the duh choice. 

Prediction: Gradual ⬆️ over a few years with a strong possibility of acquisition by larger defense contractor. I'm way too ret🅰️rded to suggest price targets. 

Move: LEAPS—as soon as they add options worth a damn to the chain. Right now, theyre only selling a few months out.

122cke9,DD,Shorting SNAP (Snapchat) - Do Diligence,"My Walmart plan did not work last time so I have taken a break to rethink my strategy and have come back with a plan.

Do Diligence:
Shorting SNAP, Projected profit: ~ $3 per share

Reasoning:
- Snapchat is out, Tik tok is in. Nobody uses Snapchat to communicate anymore. All my friends send videos of Tik tok to me through my phone. 
- Snapchat lacks features. I am bored of the features snapchat provides. They need  to innovate or be left behind.
- Snapchat has too many boys. Everytime I open Snapchat I look at my quick add and it’s always bots. So many boys and it’s getting distracting.
- Technical Analysis: everyone thinks snapchat is stable but it’s not actually. The stock price is not going up which means people don’t trust the company.


Final Verdict: Snapchat is OUT. Buy short positions now. Trust me. I am not a finacial advisor.

121amyc,DD,Now Hiring Repo Men for the Pounding Banks and Dealers are Going to Feel Soon!,"Hello my fellow Regards,

The perfect storm has been brewing for some time now and I believe CarMageddon is finally upon us.  I will keep it short and sweet so both smooth and wrinkled brains alike can profit off my DD.

**TLDR: 1st, for you Smooth Brains who wont spend the time to read through the Images and Links provided, you need to buy puts on most your Public Car Dealers and your heavy auto  lenders in the middle of April as we rally.**

&#x200B;

**Thesis:**  Used Car Value are going to plumet, leaving both Banks and US Car Dealers holding some hefty losses in Q2,Q3,Q4.

&#x200B;

**Why?:** No secret to anyone who has thought about buying a car the last year but Inflation has had an Inverse effect on Automobiles, especially Used ones, **until now.**  March of 2021 there was a fire at the semiconductor factory in Taiwan, this caused huge shortages of new cars, thus increasing the price of used.  Prices on New and Used cars increased much more dramatically due to nearly free money, caused by all the QE and lots of ""Regards"" buying depreciating assets way over value.  It was kind of crazy, 10k+ over sticker and 30+% more for the same used car that they could have bought for that much less just a couple months prior.  This irrational exuberance bubbled out of control and greedy banks handed out loans left and right at crazy multiples to help assist the US in the ""Great Reopening"".  This helped Public and Private Franchise Dealers alike make record profits and their stocks have been soaring at ATH since.  All the while, these Dealers and Banks have all but guaranteed their avg customer a fate of negative equity and or a likely visit from the REPO MAN.

&#x200B;

**How did this happen?:**  You see my friends, here in America we are truly ""Regarded"".  When we want something, especially something that we know is bad for us, we sell ourselves on why its ok.  Sure, its a terrible financial decision but the bank is ok with lending me the money for it, so it cant be that bad right?... It's kind of like 0 DTE options, its completely regarded, but the bank is ok with me doing it. LOL

I digress...  Well now everything is about to change.  Cars are starting to fill back up on the new car lots and for the dealers who still don't have any New cars, that's a bigger problem for their earnings.  Used car prices have spiked this month do to seasonal buying for tax time and if demand doesn't tick up this tax season, well then these Auto Dealers just bought their largest liability(used cars) at the top.  Basically car dealers are doing what most you regards did in Nov-Dec 2021 before everything came crashing down.  I figure, with the soaring delinquency's and revised used car SAAR, we are about to see a huge drop in used car prices, dealers profits and a huge increase in banks losses do to this economic hurricane the FED, Bankers and QE/QT has created.

&#x200B;

**When is all this going to happen?:**  I think it will all come to a head in the next 30-60 days.  Why am I so confident prices will drop?  I'm glad you asked, check out the graphs and links provided, its pretty clear CarMageddon is upon us.

&#x200B;

**How am I going to play this?:**  On the next rally we get I am going to short the top auto lenders in the attached links.  I have already opened multiple positions on Public car dealers and am doing so by actually shorting the stock because premium on puts are regarded.  As far at the REPO MEN go, I am long RECOVERY EQUIPMENT COMPANY'S, I have already started accumulating one but its market cap is too low to be mentioned as of right now.

&#x200B;

Best of luck to all you regards, hope you make a bunch of money on this trade.  As always boys and girls, this is a casino and this post is absolutely not financial advice.  Cheers my fellow ""Regards"", its **MILLER** time!

121agbs,DD,MercadoLibre Investment Thesis,"#### MercadoLibre, Inc.

#### Ticker: MELI

#### Sector: Consumer Cyclical

#### Market Cap: $59.9 billion

#### 1. Overview

MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI) is the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America, serving 18 countries. It provides six integrated e-commerce and digital financial services including Mercado Libre Marketplace, Mercado Pago Fintech platform, Mercado Envios logistics service, Mercado Credito, Mercado Ads solution, and Mercado Shops online storefronts solution. 

**Mercado Libre Marketplace** is an online commerce platform accessible through website and mobile app. It allows sellers, merchants, and individuals to list and sell merchandise across various categories such as electronics, apparel, home goods, toys, books, and consumer packaged goods.

**Mercado Envios** is a logistics solution offered by MELI in several countries. It allows sellers on the platform to use third-party carriers and logistics services, as well as offering warehousing and fulfillment services. By using Mercado Envios, sellers can offer a streamlined shipping experience to buyers and may be eligible for shipping subsidies. The volume Mercado Envios manages through its network means that it can offer better prices to merchants on logistic services.

**Mercado Pago** is a digital payments solution developed by MELI initially to facilitate secure and easy transactions on its Marketplaces. It now has evolved to offer a financial technology ecosystem in the digital and physical worlds, including checkout and payment processes for merchants on their own websites and physical stores as well as credit offerings to scale their business. Mercado Pago is available in several Latin American countries and aims to provide end-to-end financial technology solutions to underserved individuals and businesses, including those operating in the informal economy.

**Mercado Credito** is a credit solution available in several Latin American countries. It leverages MELI's loyal and engaged user base, both offering credit lines to online merchants and mobile point of sale device users as well as to buyers on and off Mercado Libre’s marketplace.

Mercado Pago credit card was launched in Brazil in 2021, allowing users to pay in installments and earn additional points from its loyalty program, Mercado Puntos.

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Have That Magical Flavor ✨
Muggles dabble in technical analysis and indicator-based trading, using past price performances to predict today's crucial price levels, much like wandering the halls of Hogwarts without a Marauder's Map.

This bewitching analysis is concocted with the essence of the current option open interest. We then stir in portfolio-level greeks (Delta and Gamma, not to be confused with Dobby and Grawp!). With this enchanting potion brewing, we can now simulate the change in greeks at various price points, revealing the most magical price levels.

Some tickers might have their prices swerve like a nimble Snitch, reacting vigorously to delta neutral, gamma max, or even both.
These (almost) time-turner-like reactions from the past are what drive our trading signals.

The plays and target entry prices are calculated using a supernatural binomial option pricing model, displaying the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. Many of these tricks are fruitful with underlying stock moves, while the best plays benefit from both the directional move and the increased IV.

## Notes - Hermione's Secret Grimoire 📚
- If the price apparates past the entry price, be cautious. Time has advanced, and changes may have occurred.
- Upon doubling your position, consider selling half as if it's a well-timed Accio! charm, leaving the rest to exit at your discretion.
- I typically risk 1% of my capital on trades I take. If I'm feeling like a cautious Hermione, I'll allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital and gently use Hermione's infamous Time-Turner to dollar cost average in.
- These trades were calculated pre-market open, based on information from the Restricted Section. Keep this in mind and seek fresher insights from The Daily Prophet.
## FAQ - The Leviosa of Curiosities 🧙‍♀️
- Are most of these plays puts? Are you a dementor of the bear variety?
   * Not at all! It just so happens that these companies have had a recent run-up mimicking a game of exploding snap! These trades readjust the balance like a time-tested countercharm.
- Are you engaging in all these magical plays?
   * No, I simply offered spells from my book of mystical trades to lead fellow wizards to the Gringotts vaults. Use your Divination skills to find the right play!
- What if there's a new spell for the same ticker from the past?
   * The old spell fizzled—embrace the new one. Yesterday's enchantment doesn't account for today's revelations.
- Do these charms include actual crayons or just words?
   * Seek the magic within the links above.
- Have these spells been tested in the Chamber of Secrets?
   * Yes, with a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error).
- How well do these potions fare in the Hogwarts history books?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance, there's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77% (Stats as of 2023-02-28).

There wont be a pre market update and most likely will not have a daily TA posted Monday night either. Everything will be back to normal on Tuesday.

Honestly what truly is incredible to me… is the fact that two days ago JPOW himself… the literal head of the fed… said “rate cuts are not in our base case” and end the FOMC press conference with that statement… and not even two days later the market said “I hear you JPOW but we are actually going to price in another bps rate cut.”

I mean trust me I understand that the markets don’t trust JPOW and what not… but I mean the fact that during the presser JPOW even said the markets had it wrong and the markets literally did not care is pretty mind blowing. 

As of right now by January 2024 there is currently 125bps of rate CUTS priced in… while JPOW and pretty much all of the fed members agreed there would be no rate cuts for 2023… Someone is very very wrong… the question is… who is wrong? And how big of a reaction will it be when that finally comes to fruition.

In an absolute last second move to push green SPY actually impressively established a new demand (Support) on the daily at 393.07 seconds before market closed. Now I mentioned I was bearish until we tested 390.1 support and would be bearish until a new demand (support) was established at which point I would look for an opportunity to ride calls back to 399.1 supply (resistance) minimally. 

Well that situation played out nearly perfectly today on a supply to demand level. 

With the daily here our target remains 399.07. If we were to break through 399.07 then our target would once again be 405.17. However, if we reject 399.07 again or establish a new supply between 399 and 405 then we could once again look for a short to ride back down. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

From a strictly supply and demand weekly stand point here we established that 385.9 demand (support) two weeks ago which was just above the 382.21 demand (support) from December. That has since been cemented as a extreme strong support. 

As bearish as I was the supply and demand is staying that we should be looking for a long here until a new supply is established (Resistance) or we reach 412.53 supply (resistance). 

Based on the daily and weekly supply/ demand currently my upside targets at 399.07 -> 405.17 -> 412.53 or until a new daily and weekly supply (resistance) is established. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

From a daily stand point here price action wise I mentioned my first target was 390.1 and that if we were able to break through that then my ultimate target would be 378. However, today and yesterday has solidified this 390 area as support once again. Not only did the bulls bounce this off a major support line they also managed to bullish engulf and close back over the daily 8 and 20ema. 

The next target I have here for spicy on a daily price action stand point is 399 (daily 200ema) and then 405.2. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5oqy1ce9brpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=41d36ef21156b7238aa7e3ac927cf32ae6008fb9

Now the weekly chart here on SPY is actually a little more difficult in my opinion. The daily I find myself and on supply/ demand extreme bullish. However, the weekly here is clearly still in a down trend (black channel) and has a very possible v bottom with a gravestone doji bearish reversal candle. 

Not only that on a weekly timeframe we are still under 396 resistance and failed once again to close back over the weekly 8/ 20ema. 

This red v bottom weekly support sits at 398.9 for Monday which basically means that if we do not open green Monday then we break this support and that does open the downside for SPY. However, another potentially more important to support to watch is the 390.1 With us retaking and closing back over that resistance and establishing it as support here does lead to upside potential. 

400 is that black bear channels resistance and where we should keep our eyes on. If we break through that then that is further upside confirmation. 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/umxf3tx9brpa1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=40835badaa30c231c9ae928ac5153cb3fe7147fb

Looking at futures we have a very similar case here where a new demand (support) was established at 3972 today. With this new higher demand (support) being established over top of 3945 then we only naturally will look for upside. Our upside target should remain at 4040 and 4055. Now as you can see we do have an old demand (now resistance) at 4095. 

There is a very real scenario where we actually could push all the way back to 4095 before we reject (establish new supply/ resistance). That would set us up for a scenario to come back down and take out the 4040/4045 supply which would really open up the upside potential here. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Now much like SPY the weekly supply and demand is extremely bullish. This weekly pop here actually established a new demand (Support) at 3915. And not only that but it took out previous demand at 3972. 

With that demand now taken out our upside target remains 4055 -> 4150. Or at least until we establish a new supply (resistance) somewhere between here and there. 

Based off futures supply and demand on both daily and weekly I see no reason to short this (now). My first target is 4055 followed by 4150 area.

Now the futures daily here appears to be forming a massive cup and handle… The last time we had a cup and handle this nice was back in December where we saw this rally form 3800s to 4100s. 

From a bullish stand point we once again test 3945 support and bounced. Not only that but the daily 8 ema is about to bullishly cross back over the daily 20ema. The bulls one again reclaimed the daily 8, 20 50 and 100ema. The last defense that the bears have here is the daily 200ema at 4010. IF and when the bulls get back through that resistance and close over it the upside potential is very high. 

This cup and handle sees a potential breakout to 4160 area and breakdown back to the 4000-4050 area. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Much like SPY weekly this is much more bearish to neutral than anything else is. There is a real clear v-bottom here on the weekly with a support at 3950 and resistance of the blue bear channel at 4040. 

Next week 3950 and 4040 should be our key levels. 

One thing to note is that the JPM call side of the collar remains at 4020 and the put side at 3600… Most of the time (at least in the bear market) we did see a closure on quarterly opex (which is Friday 3/31) closer to the puts than calls. However, last OPEX we flipped the script and actually ended up closer to the call side. If that is the cast then 4020 will be our target and we should expect price action to be around that level Friday at market close. Though I would really not put the same weight into that as we were able to in 2022. 

**VIX**

Note- skipping on 10yr and DXY today as lately I have not found enough correlation to even find it helpful… but I will as I do not continue to keep an eye on it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bt8kcezbbrpa1.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24ad75bcceee924457c23c0795e56a9162298bf6

Now once again on the VIX we have found ourselves with an extremely large push up only to by the end of the day give it all back up. With these extremely long wicks to the upside and a closure back under the daily 8 and 20ema on the VIX this too supports a downside move on the VIX and upside move on SPY.

There are good days and bad days in the market… today was a bad day… I went into the day being patient and waiting for a more clear sign of a breakout. I unfortunately ended up getting stopped out on calls and puts with fakeouts. 

From there it pretty much just went down hill. I was holding those 28dte 392 puts and I was pretty green this morning on them. While I expect a lot of fight at 390.1 I did not expect market to bounce the way it did and fully anticipated a breakdown only to cut my loser EOD. I just found myself almost all day on the wrong side of the play. 

That morning call I stopped out of I had a sell order for 5% that didn’t fill and had two plays immediately after that I tried to enter into and was unable to get filled in. 

Tough day of trading but ended up putting in a pretty good week though so no complaints from that stand point but I sure gave up a lot today unfortunately.",DaddyDersch,48,0.81,43,0,0,43,11,2023-03-24T21:41:17Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/120zpb5/bulls_are_back_in_control_the_ole_cup_and_handle/

120nphc,DD,Backstopping deposits doesn't mean the banks won't fail - here's who's next,"Huntington National Bank, puts all the way down the chain 30 DTE. 

Why? When comparing them to signature bank, they have had a similar influx in deposits since the pandemic and even greater losses on their AFS positions.

Yes, there are plenty of other regional banks that could fit this bill and have similar trends, but $HBAN has had the highest losses on their AFS positions. So if there is any sort of triggering event over the next 30 days where deposits start to decline and they are forced to sell their AFS portfolio, it would have a more significant impact on their capital then other banks (since banks can exclude losses that are sitting in OCI from their capital calculations).",FootieBoisElite,60,0.89,107,0,0,107,1,2023-03-24T15:28:21Z,False,False,t2_j8ufxbp8,9,70,2,13,2022-02-01T15:10:50Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/120nphc/backstopping_deposits_doesnt_mean_the_banks_wont/

He posted a screenshot of the wrong Sigma Lithium on LinkedIn and said it had like 3 employees – the real Sigma Lithium LinkedIn page shows like 80 employees (it's a $3 billion company lol). Completely disregarded company disclosures about its environmental licenses. Said that it might be involved in child labor or worker mistreatment because of a stupid calculation where it tried to back out average wages, completely misunderstanding how salaries tied to PP&E construction are accounted for.

This guy Fiat Lux Partners blasted them for all of it and Grizzly had to walk back the LinkedIn thing. Looks like people are pressing for a bigger retraction now.

120j4g6,DD,S&P PMI Today - Daily Trading Report,"Today is looking like it is going to be a rough day for the general markets. There is a significant amount of bearish momentum at the moment, which will impact people’s ability to actively trade and navigate in the short term. Realistically, I believe that lots of people will have a difficult time as a result of this momentum, but there will be many opportunities to day trade and scalp.   


Max pain is right at $390 today, so it would not surprise me if we stay around this area for the majority of the day, with a lack of general momentum and volume as people are confused at the moment. We are still edging closer to extreme fear in the fear and greed index. If the market conditions continue this way in the short term, it will provide us all with a great opportunity to go long, so scale into your positions slowly and be safe with any positions.   


For the majority of traders, I would recommend you look into selling highly OTM 0-DTE CSPs today. Volatility is at a relative high, while equities are a little bit cheaper. As always, this won’t be a significant amount of realized gains, nor create any life-changing money, but will provide us all with an amazing opportunity to realize some gains with relative ease and extremely low stress. Look for organizations that are severely undervalued at this moment, with a sizable amount of premium that you will be able to capitalize on.

This is part of a larger problem since the great recession with American [placing less trust into the banking system as a whole](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-not-just-silicon-valley-bank-americans-havent-trusted-banks-for-years/). With this lack of confidence in regional banks larger US banks have seen an influx of deposits as consumers move away from these local/regional institutions.

But there's one place that doesn't have a major presence of [major US banks branches](https://money.cnn.com/2012/11/28/pf/banks-hawaii/) or much exposure to the rest of the financial system. Hawaii. There are numerous reasons for this including the [geographic isolation from the mainland](https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A21119270/AONE?u=anon~a99afd5a&sid=bookmark-AONE&xid=42ae1456). Looking at banking sector in Hawaii it becomes clear as to why this market is structurally different than banking in the rest of the country. The industry is effectively an oligopoly with 93% of deposits held by four banks and the two largest regional banks in the state (Bank of Hawaii and First Hawaiian Bank) holding 68% of deposits. The largest bank headquartered out of state by market share only holds 0.87% of the states deposits. We see the two companies post regular profits, have market caps over $2 billion, and offer \~3-5% dividend yields. There is a downside to these dividends in that a majority of the income from these banks is returned in dividends and not invested. BOH's dividend payout ratio is 50.9%, FHB is 50%, the sector average is \~30%.  On the other hand this may explain why they aren't as exposed to market forces as other banks.

* ITM (in-the-money) and ATM (at-the-money) are terms used to describe the relationship between an option's strike price and the price of the underlying asset.
* An ITM option is one where the strike price is below (for a call option) or above (for a put option) the current price of the underlying asset.
* An ATM option is one where the strike price is approximately equal to the current price of the underlying asset.
* ITM options are generally more expensive than ATM options due to their intrinsic value.

11zqoe8,DD,PSLV vs THE WORLD - Must read for gold and silver bugs.,"More and more people are thinking about protecting themselves from financial crisis with gold and silver.

I wanted to take a moment to remind the community that PSLV (or PHYS) is the best way to purchase physical silver (or gold).

I am going to first show you **why this is the case**, then I am going to tell you **why it matters** that we all understand this.

*(While I recommend you all read the prospectus' of any potential investment yourself, and understand the risks yourself, I let me summarize my own personal findings. This is an opinion, not an official legal interpretation.)*

The long and short of it is that PSLV (or the gold equivalent PHYS) are the only exchange traded funds that guarantee that the fund is fully allocated in actual bullion.

All other funds make no promise that they are actually purchasing cold hard metal.

# IT'S STATED IN PLAIN SIGHT:

Check this out from the top of the PSLV fact sheet:

&#x200B;

[ https:\/\/sprott.com\/investment-strategies\/physical-bullion-trusts\/silver\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/12ujhsfetipa1.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b309085f0eb66125ba5c66d91bc79fa1a30c9243)

In contrast, this is what the SLV fact sheet says. This fund does not even claim or pretend to be actual silver. It says it **ATTEMPTS TO GENERALLY REFLECT THE PRICE MOVEMENT** of silver:

&#x200B;

[ https:\/\/www.ishares.com\/us\/literature\/fact-sheet\/slv-ishares-silver-trust-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/8iwueixetipa1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d18f1aba4901b0940ca3cc6cc16566c4890ebbe3)

# ONE OF MANY PROSPECTUS DETAILS:

There is a LOT of information in the prospectus of any fund - and you should read them - but check out this seemingly tiny but materially important difference.

PSLV says in no uncertain terms that they are purchasing actual bullion, and they don't mess around with certificates or any other financial instruments or derivatives:

[ PSLV Prospectus - https:\/\/sprott.com\/media\/1451\/pslv-prospectus-en.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/1y41uaabuipa1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=67edece5047802298b29f79f5b9f1b913847f535)

Again, in stark contrast, SLV very sneakily sildes in two little words that enables them to have their silver holdings represented by ""unallocated accounts"" - AKA IOU's.

Okay, so we don't want unallocated promissory notes, but just how much of the world's paper metal is ""unallocated""? Well quite a lot. Almost all of it actually.

Look at this straight from the LBMA website, it states 2 things... First, that an unallocated account is just an IOU. And secondly, that the overwhelming majority of their accounts are unallocated:

[ lbma.org.uk\/publications\/the-otc-guide\/precious-metal-accounts ](https://preview.redd.it/pud4uw4htipa1.png?width=1984&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62e7c31d8bbcdf1ac7d76deaee8dc64c0a1ed0d0)

This point about 90% being unallocated is very important. This transparent statement about unallocated accounts tells you everything you need to know about most paper ETFs: MOST OF THEIR HOLDINGS ARE UNALLOCATED.

&#x200B;

When LBMA is telling you that 90%+ of the accounts are unallocated, and most of the major metal ETFs are storing their metals in ""allocated or unallocated"" accounts at the LBMA, that means that 90% of the metal ETFs are unallocated.

I want to show you one more thing from the SLV prospectus. Again, if you read the prospectus, which you should, you will see them telling you pretty clearly that the LBMA does whatever the hell it wants and they're liable for almost nothing:

# SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

1. For reasons relating to security and practical financial considerations, putting all your money into actual cold hard bullion is not always realistic.
2. If you have to put some money into paper gold and silver, the PSLV (or PHYS) are the most likely to actually be worth anything if and when the mother of all shit storms (MOASS) occurs .
3. **MOST IMPORTANTLY - When people and institutions are buying funds in UNALLOCATED ETF's, it has minimal impact on the actual price. These funds have the ability create infinite IOU's for gold and silver that do not exist.**
4. MOREOVER - When people and institutions are buying ALLOCATED gold and silver, it is creating REAL DEMAND FOR REAL PM'S. That mean's it is driving supply down, prices up and draining the comex.

&#x200B;

# BUY PSLV AND PHYS FOR YOUR PAPER PM NEEDS FOLKS.

11ywymo,DD,So how deep is this banking crisis?,"So I was watching an [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bank-risk-building-many-many-153033110.html) with a Columbia University professor who was a co-author on a recent research [study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31048) and in it, they've identified several banks (only name SVB since it already collapsed) that were ""insolvent"" with mark-to-market losses. Other than SVB, they identified 3 banks with assets over $200 billion and based on [Federal Reserve List of U.S. Banks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/) we can deduct who the 3 are and they've been in the news lately, so no surprise.

However, the surprise to me was they identified 1 bank (Bank A in blue dot on Figure 5) with over $1 trillion in assets. There are only 4 banks in the U.S. with over $1 trillion in assets, JPM, BoA, Citibank, and Wells-Fargo. Since JPM and BoA have assets over $3 trillion and $2 trillion respectively, we can assume the $1 trillion figure may point to either Citibank or Wells-Fargo if we go by that Federal Reserve list above. 

Here's Figure 5 from the study:

11ypqb5,DD,The Best Inverse ETFs to Trade - Inverse ETF List,"Inverse ETF:

A type of exchange-traded (ETF) fund designed to deliver returns that are the opposite of an underlying index's performance. In other words, if the index goes down by 2%, the inverse ETF should ideally go up by 2%.

Additionally, there are 2x and 3x inverse ETFs. If you buy a 3x inverse ETF and the index moves up 2%, your 2x inverse ETF should move 6%. 

How Inverse ETFs Work:

Inverse ETFs achieve their objectives using financial derivatives, such as options, futures contracts, or swaps. These instruments allow the ETF to ""short"" the market, profiting from a decline in the value of the underlying index. 

It's important to note that the performance of inverse ETFs is generally measured over a single day, meaning their returns can diverge significantly from the index when held for longer periods.

11yldzr,DD,Eggcellent DD - Cal-Maine Foods ($CALM),"Price Gouging. That should be music to any investor’s ears. Whether it’s true or not, doesn’t really matter. Cal-Maine Foods ($CALM) is in the egg business. I’m sure you’ve heard about egg prices. Not only are they in the egg business but they are the biggest player in the US egg business. Prices for eggs were greatly elevated because of the Avian Flu going around killing 5 million chickens in December alone. As of their last update, $CALM has lost exactly 0 chickens to Avian Flu.

Snippet of price gouging letter from Elizabeth Warren and Katie Porter to $CALM CEO:

*“In the midst of record-high egg prices, your company, the largest egg producer in the United States, announced a 65% annual increase in profits in the third quarter of 2022, and no positive cases of avian flu.”*

Hint: its not price gouging though. It isn’t their fault prices have gone up due to Avian Flu. What are they supposed to do? Sell them at normal levels even though competitors have to sell them for twice as much?

Largest market share in the US… 0 sick chickens. See snippet below from their latest 10-Q Filing:

*“We are closely monitoring the current outbreak of HPAI that was first detected in commercial flocks in the U.S. in February 2022. Outbreaks in commercial flocks in the U.S. have most recently occurred during each month from September to December 2022. The current HPAI epidemic has surpassed the prior 2014-2015 outbreak in terms of the number of affected hens in the U.S., and HPAI continues to circulate throughout the wild bird population in the U.S. and abroad. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these detections do not present an immediate public health concern.* ***There have been no positive tests for HPAI at any Cal-Maine Foods’ owned or contracted production facility as of December 28, 2022.*** *The USDA division of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) reported on December 27, 2022 that approximately 43.3 million commercial layer hens and 1.0 million pullets have been depopulated due to HPAI this year. We believe the HPAI outbreak will continue to exert downward pressure on the overall supply of eggs, and the duration of those effects will depend in part on the timing of replenishment of the U.S. layer hen flock. Prior to the outbreak of HPAI in February 2022, the layer hen flock five-year average from 2017 through 2021 was comprised of approximately 328 million hens. According to a LEAP Market Analytics report dated December 8, 2022, the layer hen inventory is not projected to exceed this 328 million mark again until December of 2023. Layer hen numbers reported by the USDA as of December 1, 2022 were 308.3 million, which represents a decrease of 5.8% compared with the layer hen inventory a year ago. However, the USDA reported that the hatch from July 2022 through November 2022 increased 5.8% as compared with the prior-year period.* ***While no farm is immune from HPAI, we believe we have implemented and continue to maintain robust biosecurity programs across our locations.*** *We are also working closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of this and future outbreaks and effectively manage our response, if needed.”*

This means that while competitors have had to raise prices to offset their losses, $CALM has raised their prices along with the market but no lost chickens. Massive revenue but without the losses.  Now let’s look at the numbers. $CALM reports Q3 earnings on March 28th after-hours. It covers the period from December 2022 – February 2023. Their current market cap is around $2.4 billion with a P/E ratio of 5.6. This is a hell of a value play, even without the massive upside.

Earnings results for prior period September - November 2022:

Revenue: $801.7 million

Net Income: $198.6 million

Earnings per share: $4.07

See egg price chart below (previous quarter highlighted in yellow, current quarter in green):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vkd82d430bpa1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8dfc7ff9cbc7e8b617aa7ea65e8f747b2be1ca38

Average egg price last quarter (yellow): $3.31

Average egg price this quarter (green): $4.43

Those are retail prices. Wholesale will be about 80% of that.

Now, two assumptions I will be making, but they will both be on the pessimistic side: 1) they will be selling about the same amount of eggs as last quarter. Not a crazy assumption because Thanksgiving (pies) and Christmas (cookies) are two of their biggest months. In fact, last year their Q3 beat their Q2. 2) Cost of sales will be a straight % of revenue. I really don’t think that is likely to happen. It is more likely to stay flat, not like their costs go up a ton just because competitors are having bird flu issues. These are my rough estimates for their earnings:

Revenue: $1,007 million

Net Income: $400 million

Earnings per share: $7.95

Current Analyst Forecasts (Yahoo Finance):

Revenue: $853.8 million

Net Income: $260 million

Earnings per share: $4.52

It should be noted that even the current analyst forecasts would easily be $CALM’s best quarter ever. And I think they are going to shatter them.

The play: stock and options. I’m doing both. Sit on it for another 4 weeks post earnings and hit ex-div date. They are required by by-laws to pay out at least 1/3 of profit every quarter in dividends. This resulted in a $0.77 dividend last quarter for an annualized rate of 5.65%. Not bad in these current times. If my earnings estimate were to be close to accurate that would push the dividend to $1.53 and the annualized rate to over 11%. Even the analyst forecasts would push it over 7%. All this to say, I think CALM is going to pop as soon as earnings come out.

Is it a long-term hold? I don’t think so. But I do think people/institutions are going to pile into a stock that is crushing it while the rest of the market shits the bed. The long-term success will be determined by future Avian Flu outbreaks but I think institutions will at least hold their positions until they get a clearer position on what that looks like over the summer. Institutions hold 91.7% of the outstanding stock.

11yjo3n,DD,Insider Trading Weekly Update #031: A(nother) Buffett of Oil | Financial Sector Insiders Buy Bank Shares in Droves | Insider Trading Recap,"GM,

TL;DR - **Buffet and Icahn cannot get enough oil.** While Buffet drove the majority of purchases by injecting $466M into $OXY, Icahn sunk further into Southwest Gas ($SWX) with a handful of buys amounting to $26.58M.

Interestingly enough, it seems that the Fed’s decision to backstop Silicon Valley Bank may have influenced insider buying activity by insiders from banks. There are a few details that jump out in today’s update:

* The Top 5 Percent Increases in Shares Owned came from regional/local banks
* The CEO of Charles Schwab bought $2.96M
* The CFO of Charles Schwab bought $289K
* The CFO of East West Bancorp ($EWBC) bought $495K
* The Buy/Sell ratio for the Financials sector was 3.1 ($61.3M buys / $19.6M sales)
* 150 insiders from the Financials sector purchased shares - 6.9x more than the sales
* $18M of C-Suite transactions came from the Financials sector - the highest overall

It might simply be a coincidence, though I have a gut feeling that this is tied to the recent turmoil in the financial sector. It seems that there could be increased confidence among corporate insiders that Jerome will step into either lower rates or bail out banks if others go under due to insolvency.

Would love to hear your views on the buying activity in the Financial sector. We’ll see what happens later today in the meeting…

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **March 13th - March 17th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **March 6th - March 10th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind[ Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

11ydq3o,DD,time to short the absolute fuck out of NVDA - P/E of 120 with stalled revenue and declining earnings growth,"Looking at the financials of this company over the past 4 years:

1. P/E of 120
2. Revenue is slowly growing (8% a year) BUT...
3. declining earnings growth (**-19% a year**)
4. Dependent on the Auto industry which has seen a slight decline is sales
5. They sell a non-unique commodity that can be easily substituted by other competitors
6. They dumped all their money into US Treasuries, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities which has tanked their porfolio
7. Auto buyers are looking at more economical options with a looming recession and economic slowdown, lowering the insurance premiums paid by each customer.

Oh wait, shit, i'm talking about an insurance company, **Progressive Corporation (PGR)**, not a tech company like NVDA which actually has a shot at growing into their P/E potential.

fuck it, I was shorting NVDA as well.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Yummy in My Tummy (Jagshemash!)

Very nice! Technical analysis and make indicator friend use old prices to guess important prices now.

Here we do analyze of current option open interest. We make big brain play by calculating portfolio-level greeks - mostly Delta and Gamma. Then, using greeks we find best price levels for max gamma and near-neutral delta.

Sometimes, stock price make big move around these levels. We use past reactions to make smart decisions for buy and sells.

Calculations use binomial option pricing model for simulate size and duration of price move. Best plays get money from both direction and increase in IV.

# Notes - Wrinkle in Brain, More Knowledge

* Price moved past entry price? Be careful like road in Kazakhstan! Something changed since plays were calculated.
* Double position profit? Sell half, freeroll rest at your choice.
* Me bet 1% of all money on trades. Unsure? Bet 0.5% or 0.25% and make dollar-cost average.
* Plays calculated before market open. Be aware when enter after. New price can break our big brain analysis.

# FAQ - Because Already Been Asked

* Many puts. You gay bear?
    * No, no. Some company price too high, like castle in the sky. Play mean-revert to or away from important price.
* You do all these plays?
    * No, no. Share many play here for all apes make gain porn. Use extra brain, pick favorite play, make win.
* New play same ticker, what do?
    * Old play not good anymore, like expired cheese. Say goodbye. Follow new play.
* Where crayons? See words only.
    * Click link above, find tasty crayon.
* Back-test, you do?
    * Yes, yes! We see Sharpe Ratio 1.76, win rate 63% (error margin 7%, not bad!)
* History perform?
    * Realized Sharpe Ratio 1.88, win rate 66%. 95% sure win rate between 62% and 77%.

11wy566,DD,[DD] Trump is getting arrested tomorrow. Puts on SPX,"From CNBC:

> Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen left the grand jury **without being called to rebut testimony from another attorney, Robert Costello, who was expected to cast doubt on Cohen’s credibility**.

Robert Costello testified on behalf of Trump. The judicial system allows Cohen to clapback to said testimony. The prosecutor said it wasn't even necessary. (AKA nothing of substance was said that warranted additional clarifying testimony)

> “Mr. Cohen was available for over two hours today, but we are pleased to report Mr. Cohen was not needed,” Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said.

> “Once again we repeat: **the facts and documents speak for themselves. Facts do matter,**” Davis told CNBC, as Costello was still appearing before the grand jury.

They have enough proof. Costello can say whatever he wants, the forensic accounting / paper trails / communication records / witness testimony speaks for itself

> Cohen told NBC News that the lead prosecutor in the case determined that he was not needed to rebut Costello, his former legal advisor.

> **Costello was prepared to tell grand jurors that Cohen is a liar** who blamed Trump for his own legal troubles, and that he has embellished allegations against the former president, WNBC reported.

Was brought in to discredit the witness, couldn't do so.

Trump is going to get arrested tomorrow. Keep in mind, former presidents don't get arrested like we get arrested. He's going to be securely brought in, accompanied by secret service agents (he has protection for life) to give his own account. He'll then be released on his own recognizance (basically super famous people that can't hide don't have to pay bail for non-violent offenses)

11wt34x,DD,Some quick math on FRC,"I have no idea if FRC is going to make it. While the depositors will be ok, that is a very different question from the stockholders.

FRC has a $2 billion market cap right now with 186 million shares outstanding. The current WSJ articles suggest that the $30 billion of deposits injected by other banks could be converted to ""a capital infusion"". This likely means an EQUITY infusion. How would that work?

If the current 186 million shares are worth $2 billion, the dilution would be massive. Let's assume that $30 billion is ""invested"" at the current price of $12. FRC would issue 2.5 BILLION SHARES. The highest market cap the company ever saw was roughly $40 billion. Pro forma for the new shares, that would translate into a stock price of $15 (40 / (2.5+.186)).

To be clear, the multi year best case upside for this bank if this is the structure of the rescue is $15. Assets have plummeted and the bank's reputation is in ruins so where would it trade? Much lower.

I think it is extremely unlikely that such a deal even prices at $12 as that would be a bad investment for JPM and the other vulture banks. If the rescue price is $6, then we are looking at 5 BILLION SHARES and the pro forma ""upside"" becomes (40 / (5.186)) = $7.70 per share.

There is no reason to play in this battleground. The upside is going to the rescuers, not the shareholders.",mrmrmrj,45,0.74,34,0,0,34,0,2023-03-20T19:31:35Z,False,False,t2_ti6n2,721,6213,13,431,2016-01-05T14:35:19Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11wt34x/some_quick_math_on_frc/
11wsve3,DD,Nvidia belongs in your portfolio,"Hardy suggested I post a DD so here it goes. Apologies if this isn’t the correct format 

Full disclosure I’ve held and been long NVDA since 2015. I joined WSB during the GameStop phenomenon. I didn’t participate but thoroughly enjoyed watching it unfold and congratulations to all that profited. 

In terms of Nvidia the idea is a long term trade. Yes, I know where I’m at. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t allocate a portion of your port to long term strategy. I myself own Nvda shares and leaps but also have a portion of portfolio dedicated to options and swing trades. TLDR; my Nvda shares aren’t for sale and I probably won’t touch them for another decade

Nvidia is the most disruptive company in the market. The runway in front of them is enormous and people are underestimating their ability to disrupt. Think of it as an iPhone moment. The world is about to change and NVDA stands to benefit enormously. Everyone is well aware of their current customers - legacy auto companies, open ai ,data center, robotics, gaming/crypto but what about their ability to disrupt future markets think Health care/genome sequencing, iot, full scale automation/robotics , quantum computing, FSD, research teams for pharmaceuticals and the list goes on forever. The opportunities are enormous and we are stepping into the golden age of technology. NVDA is your ticket to ride 

I’ve heard the arguments about P/E and valuation and I get it. It’s a fair point. But what if this company is richly valued for a reason? What if the market is pricing in the insane amount of disruptive opportunities in front of it. I think yes and I’ll be riding with Jensen for the next decade (at least) maybe more. 

I would encourage all that are interested in NVDA to listen in on NVDA GTC which kicks off tomorrow.",Jutty1026,102,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,2023-03-20T19:24:32Z,False,False,t2_43cp816f,101,1270,13,199,2020-05-30T00:29:00Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11wsve3/nvidia_belongs_in_your_portfolio/

As the supply of magnesium alloy metal in the US is running slim, keep an eye on Western Magnesium Corporation MLYF to see if it continues its uptrend as the only clean, non-toxic, low-energy, waterless magnesium producer in the US!  **They will be the only magnesium manufacturer left in America after the government is working to shut down Utah based US Magnesium for being toxic and using to much water out of the Great Salt Lake!** Western Magnesium uses a new clean, non-toxic, low-energy process from dolomite here in the US for producing top grade magnesium metal for many industries, including auto, steel, aluminum, and the DOD! Magnesium metal is extremely light: it is 75% lighter than steel, 50% lighter than titanium, and 33% lighter than aluminum.  It has the highest known damping capacity of any structural metal, capable of withstanding 10x more than aluminum, titanium, or steel! Many large automotive companies have already replaced steel and aluminum with magnesium in various parts of their products to lighten the load. They already own land in Nevada, where they are working to move their operations already in test production and plan to ship to ports on the west coast. Magnesium alloys are a much needed strong, light weight metal in today's industries. Just think of how much further cars, trains, & planes could go by reducing their weight from heavy metals! The US needs a clean supply of magnesium and magnesium alloys from here at home and not rely on other dirty processes in countries like China.

11vlkut,DD,🚀🌕 NVDA: Crypto Slump Ain't Holding Us Back – Gaming Revenues Ready to Blast Off! 💥🎮,"Greetings, fellow degenerates! Buckle up, because it's time to talk about a stock that's primed for some explosive gains. 

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the unstoppable GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.

Crypto Who? 🤔
While it's true that NVIDIA has dipped its toes into the crypto waters with their Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line, don't let the current crypto slump fool you. In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue. So even if the crypto industry takes a hit, NVDA's bottom line remains resilient, and they're ready to dominate the gaming market.

Gaming Revenues: Ready for Lift-off 🚀
In the past five years, NVIDIA has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, and with a new generation of gaming consoles and blockbuster games hitting the shelves, the demand for high-performance GPUs is about to skyrocket. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are gamers' top choice, and we all know that the gaming market is booming. Global gaming industry revenue is projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, up from $159.3 billion in 2020. As more people turn to gaming for entertainment, NVIDIA is poised to reap the rewards, translating into juicy gains for us degenerate apes.

Cloud Gaming: The Next Frontier 🌌
Cloud gaming is gaining traction, and NVIDIA is already ahead of the game with its GeForce NOW platform. The cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.2% from 2021 to 2028, reaching $7.24 billion by 2028. As more gamers shift to cloud gaming, NVIDIA's gaming revenues will further soar, making the crypto industry's struggles look like a minor speed bump on the road to the moon.

So, fellow degenerates, strap in and prepare for takeoff, because NVDA is ready to show the world that the gaming industry's gains will overshadow any crypto woes. Remember, this ain't financial advice, and always do your own research. But don't be surprised if we're all partying on the moon with our sweet, sweet NVDA tendies. 🌕🍗",SlenderMan69,22,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,2023-03-19T13:34:21Z,False,False,t2_5zld1,6,124,4,4,2011-10-05T23:47:11Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vlkut/nvda_crypto_slump_aint_holding_us_back_gaming/

There was an extreme amount of fear mongering going on Friday due to uncertainty, which is not based on any fundamental analysis.  I believe the conservative value of the company to be $83 / share based on the following:

If FRC were to sell parts of its AFS or HTM securities at a loss. Assuming they require 10 billion of liquidity and incur a loss of 17%, would result in a 1.7 billion loss:

Tangible Book Value = (212,639–195,193–218–**1700**)/187 = $83

Assume a tangible P/B Ratio of 1

**Fair value = $83**

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn.

However, this was an extremely choppy and miserable day to trade.

As you can see the bank situation is far from over… last weekend we actually went into this with the same exact issue… and we were saved over the weekend and that was the 2% futures rally.. However, going into it again this weekend can the fed and the big banks save us once more? Stay tuned to find out…

As you can see next week is FOMC and as of now there is a 38.7% chance of a fed pause and a 61.3% chance of a 25bps hike… for me I don’t think that matters… I think we are pretty much guaranteed a 25bps hike… but what is more important than that? The dot plot… that dot plot is not going to look good at all.. 

With all these extra money (yes I know this isn’t QE and its not the same as jpow money printer…) but there is still almost $2 trillion extra dollars being injected into the economy right now… that is NOT going to help the fight for inflation at all.. I think JPOW is going to come off very hawkish and I would be very surprised to see him let up.

Jpow has officially found himself in the worst case scenario… he is facing a legitimate financial collapse and facing runaway inflation. He has found himself in a no win situation… something will break. And its coming quick and fast. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7fobw40b4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=910e6d496e710b8a1437e22433182d2e4ef472ed

From a daily supply and demand standpoint we are stuck between two big levels… we have our downside demand (support) at 385.87 and our upside supply (resistance) still at 405.17… the way im seeing this play out and that huge rejection off the daily 20ema yesterday with todays red inside day is that we actually are setting up for a new supply to be established at 396 on Monday. That would then open up a retest of 385.87 demand (support). 

From there we either reconfirm 385.87 as demand (support) which I find unlikely… or what I see as a higher probability is that we break through that demand and attempt to establish a new lower demand (support) somewhere between 376.67 and 385.87. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hv2dvzfb4doa1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73bace99925dd47a881e3a42ca4aba6202b7681c

From a weekly supply and demand stand point we actually have not quite come into any new levels. The biggest thing to note though is that this week we came down and nearly perfectly bounced off demand (support) at 382.21 that was established back in December. 

Until a new supply or demand is established the weekly does not provide enough details for a trade. However, it is clear that this double demand (support) area from 382.2 to 385.9 is extremely strong and we will need to see a pretty sizeable drop and more importantly closure below that in order to see further downside. The weekly as long as we hold 382.21 I actually do favor slight upside. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6b0hixb4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f5b4e3febbbb78030d133cc54d3bc9b75dcdc63a

from a daily price action stand point I actually am very bearish. The way I am seeing this right now is that this was a failed breakout (yesterday) and that this is a pretty massive bear flag forming. This bear flag has a target of 378. 

We have established a really large breakout/ down triangle which provides support at 388 and resistance at 393.7 on Monday. If one of these levels breaks that will be our first sign of where we are headed next. 

We did actually end up closing at 389.99 which puts us back under key pivot point of 390.1. This failed breakout/ recovery and closure back under that level is very bearish to me and once again sets up a run to this green channel support down at 378. The biggest thing to see here too is this is the 2nd day with a 20ema rejection and we lost the daily 8ema support again. I see far more weakness than I do strength here on SPY. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jw12l6hc4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f0b55e1a585440590a556d1de00191bf21995915

Now the weekly much like supply and demand weekly doesn’t really provide us much details. The biggest detail I see here on the weekly is the fact that we attempted to recover the weekly 8/20ema and were immediately rejected.

This rejection is very bearish and to me sets up a lower downside. Now I also note here though that we did close under 390.1 for the 2nd week in a row. This to me with 390.1 as my key weekly pivot point (and really the key yearly pivot point) find myself looking for 375-382 before looking for a retest of 396.5. 

Now the hardest thing is that we have FOMC next week which is very likely to provide turbulence and provide unpredictability but I remain bearish going into next week and I remain much like I said back 2 weeks ago bearish on FOMC and the weeks to follow. 

SPY Weekly Levels:  
 Supply- 412.53  
 Demand- 385.9 -> 382.21 -> 357.3  
 Weekly Support- 382.4 -> 375.8  
 Weekly Resistance- 390.1 -> 396.5 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fg6ai6zc4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12bd67e9c8f130ccd0dd7e222dc86141999d7a54

Just as I suspected last night we are getting a 3995 supply (resistance) established on futures. That is very bearish and tells me we are right on track for a push back to 3895 support. This current supply (resistance) and demand (support) from 3995 to 3895 has actually set up a really impressive 100 point range which we have been trading within for about 8 days now. 

With this new 3995 supply (resistance) my downside target remains 3895. IF we were to lose 3895 we should look for 3833. I actually was targeting that on Wednesday but we did not quite have the strength to get there. 

The most probable daily case is that we will establish a new demand somewhere between 3833 and 3895. This would be the bounce play and that would be when I look to go long (or at least close my short). However, I still believe there is further downside to go. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t8ytt6gd4doa1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c2566e86741e5b074aa22cd681b34e83fb440f7e

From a weekly supply and demand aspect we established that 4055 supply (resistance) the last week of February. From there we bounced off 3866 demand (support) that was established back in December. 

As of right now until a new demand (support) is established we should be looking for further downside. However, I would also play slight caution here that this 3866 level has been extremely strong and we should worry about a bigger bounce off that level. On the other hand the more that this demand is beaten on the bigger chance that we drop through it. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

The futures and spy daily patterns here tell me a lot of the same picture. However, as I was suspecting we actually came into a beautiful double top right off 3995. That 3995/4000 level has been a major pivot level for over a month now. With that rejection off the 200ema also and closing back under the daily 8ema and more importantly back under 3955 support (remember this was resistance for the last 4 trading days before we broke through it yesterday). 

Futures is set up perfectly for a retest of 3920 support. This is the major pivot level for futures. If they lose that level then we are heading back to that December consolidation support area which sits near 3800 to 3890. 

Now the breakout triangle here for the bear flag on futures actually shows a support at 3905 and resistance at 4005 for Monday. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yfphqjfe4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=636913276cd3394c180ce832602c119a28232dd0

Now futures weekly here actually closed out a massive doji candle here as opposed to that more hammer candle on SPY weekly. 

The biggest thing I note here is that we actually are perfectly rejecting the JPM collar calls at 4030. Why does that matter? Well the collar roll is officially in two weeks. Historically speaking over the last year I would say we are more likely to be at the collar puts (currently 3600) then we are to be at the calls… Now there was December collar roll where we were closer to the calls but that is not always the case.

My downside target here remains 3770 to 3850. Futures weekly also hard rejected the weekly 8, 20, 50 and 100ema this week. 

Futures weekly levels:  
 Supply- 4055  
 Demand- 3971 -> 3866 -> 3600  
 Weekly support- 3920 -> 3860 -> 3770  
 Weekly Resistance- 3975 -> 4020 -> 4075

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ngs21fze4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f8ffd58d7cc5307eebaec807c27cac7aa41b413

Now its actually the ugliest bull flag I have ever seen but there could very well be an opposing bull flag to the SPY bear flag. IF that is the case we are in for a massive push up on the VIX. I think the most important thing to note today about this VIX candle is the fact that it did not see the normal massive move up followed by a massive move down. 

This VIX candle shows me that hedges went on (since we opened at 22.92) early in the day and they never came back off the books. This market officially is positioning itself bearishly. I mentioned the daily 20ema support at 22 was the bounce spot and we actually did end up bouncing off 22.58 just over the daily 20ema. 

Upside target is once again the 28-29 range next week. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3ydn9gf4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5abadd5a4fff86514a99224b81f7a87190169e79

I had mentioned this DXY daily breakout triangle and we are still in it. The dollar didn’t quite dump to that 103.6 level of support but is now rejecting the daily 8ema and clearly trending down.

I still am learning the dollar and honestly with stocks down and the dollar down I still am trying to find the correlation and how to benefit. My thoughts are obviously the dollar is losing value with the financial system issues and potential pause/ rate hikes next week. However, I would love some feed back on others thoughts on the dollar. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4a8sewf4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7597ca845292af6d5b5f382165ce34b93c18c825

Of the VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield I actually find the 10yr to be most telling. If you take a look at the 10yr you can see that we are in a clear trend for the last 5 days now… huge drop in rates (because people are jumping to safety of the rates) followed by a huge rise in rates (markets going back to risk on) only to drop the next day. 

The thing I find most interesting today and the VIX did the same thing is that for the most part the 10YR did not recoil. TO me this shows that people found safety in bonds and this time they chose not to leave that safety. I think this is extremely telling of the future and whats to come. Market (or at lest big money) realizes how dire this banking situation is and I believe they are very much so positioning themselves for the worse right now. 

The most interesting thing is that we can not seem to break the 10yr lower than 3.395%. That has been a huge “support” since January 20th.

Today I actually found myself this morning in quite a bit of drawdown. I took some heavy losses turning in 4 losses (almost all full stop loss) out of my first 7 trades. I decided to take a little mental break and go for a walk. I came back and was able to put in 7 back to back wins in order to close out a green day. 

Overall profit wise not a bad week.  I was very happy with my Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday trading. However, the last two days I found myself being chopped up by everything. I just seemed to either 100% get stop loss hunted or hard bite the fake out. 

I found price action just to be very erratic and hard to trade. I also found that price action (and premiums) at times move so fast that I was left in the dust as premiums dumped 10-20 cents at a time. The other issue that happened a few times today is an extreme lack of pay out on premiums. I had two times in calls and one time in puts that for the DTE I use (which is my standard) I found that a move that was an easy 5-10% layup barely hit 1% profits. I watched a call and a put (at different times of course) move in my direction and lose value the whole time.

11tob1p,DD,CDR one of the strongest on Polish WIG20,"Hi, I wanted to point out how strong CDR is on the Polish WIG20 index. During the fatal session on the WIG20, on March 13, the CDR, after dropping from PLN 130 to PLN 120, rebounded very quickly to \~ PLN 129.   
Soon the results for Q4 2022, which can be great due to the revival of demand for Cyberpunk after the CP Edgerunners series and the sale of the game during the holiday season.   
This year will be the premiere of DLC for the game whose marketing campaign is to start 6 months before the premiere, which may mean that it will be launched soon.   
I believe that the value may be strong in the near future and it is worth keeping an eye on the stock. In the last few sessions, despite the poor performance of the WIG20, CDR climbed up and was one of the strongest components of the index.

11t80q0,DD,"Incognito QE and Quad witching day… 3-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield Daily Market Analysis","Well after the ECB still proceeded with a 50bps hike many would have thought that SPY would have a negative reaction today..

The big banks have stepped in an collectively along with the feds to basically prevent FRC from failing… this has officially become much like CS a “too big too fail” moment. Now whats interesting here and many are missing is that yes $2 trillion… yes trillion.. could be injected into the economy essentially to keep the banks from going under but this is a loan. This is not as easy as just printing free money… however, SPY today clearly heard “free money” and literally ran with it all day long. 

Tomorrow is quad witching day (this year is absolutely flying by!)… and with that we should absolutely expect some volatility. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9639hqhrd6oa1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb55adbab8b443bff33969f7b0e1a76e23ab6a5a

With an average open of -0.98% on quad witching days… and with this in my opinion artificial run up today… I honestly would have been very tempted to run some over night puts. However, the option chains is absolutely weird right now… 

For instance, tomorrow (at market close) a 1dte call is about 0.98 while an atm put is 2.76… that’s over double of a difference. This mostly is related to the fact that call IV is only 18% and put IV is 35%... I do not really remember a time I have seen IV this different. 

Even looking at the 4 and 5 dte puts are nearly 2x of calls and that mostly is related to IV being nearly double on puts vs. calls. 

This tells me right now that the MM is heavily protected to the downside and the upside is a cheap hedge right now. 

I would expect to see this option chain correct itself in the near future here… IF the bank run issues are truly subsided. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejjv17zrd6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=72767d28adc72d82fda184c982409ebaccf31665

As I had said as long as bulls held 385.87 with the newly established demand (support) our upside target really should have been 394.68. Well today bulls officially pushed and took out that previous demand (was resistance). 

This now makes our daily chart WIDE open… we have a huge basically $20 trading range from 385.87 to 405.17. Current trend is up and realistically until we get a new supply (resistance) put in then we turly should be looking for an upside push to 405.17. Normally I would say theres no way we hit that tomorrow… however, the fact that SPY has put in its 4th $10 range day in the last 6 trading days its actually fully within possibilities that we hit that level tomorrow… 

Now in the chances that we reject here at the daily 20ema and double top and close red tomorrow there is a very good chance that this 396.2 will become a new supply (Resistance) and that would lead me to believe a retrace back to 385.87 is coming, at least until a new higher demand (Support) is established. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k0ovjofsd6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a6d7cb62cf848c1db270156048e562a5b4f424a0

Cleaned up our chart here a little bit… we broke through the falling wedge I had mentioned yesterday. We also more importantly broke out and closed over that 391.8 black channel resistance. This should as supply/ demand also mentions be an upside breakout trend. 

With the bulls finally reclaiming a close over the daily 8ema for the first time in 8 trading days… we should look for the bulls to close over the daily 20ema tomorrow. That would also signify further upside to be expected. 

IF you look here there actually that similar 385.8 to 405.2 channel that the supply/ demand shows. There is definitely a case and expectation that we could test 405.2 before we see a new resistance put in. 

However it also should be noted that since February 2nd we have been in a clear downtrend. The ultimate bull target for market close tomorrow is a closure over 400 to retake the daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. That would in my opinion solidify (outside of new bad banking news) a breakout to 405+ leading into FOMC. Bears tomorrow ultimately going into the weekend need a closure back under 390.1 ideally and minimally back under 391.8 (daily 8ema). 

SPY Levels:  
 Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 385.87 -> 376.67  
 Daily support- 394.7 -> 391.8 -> 390.1  
 Daily Resistance- 396.1 -> 397.8 -> 399.7 -> 401.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Futures called this upside shot before SPY did but with 3895 holding as demand (support) until a new supply (resistance) is established realistically we should be looking for a push to 4055 supply (resistance). 

Until we tag 4055 or establish a new lower supply (resistance) we should continue to expect an upside push on Futures. Futures did however close over its daily 20ema which also signifies upside potential tomorrow. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k85qradtd6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc836535014e0c94bbb401d6c87b7230f856c12a

The more I look at this the more I actually see a potential large daily bear flag. If you follow the red resistance line down as long as bears can hold under that line and if they potentially can turn tomorrow into a double top off 3995 then we actually could see downside into next week. However, if the bulls close over 3995 tomorrow and especially if they can close us over 4013 then I truly do expect upside into next week. 

The bulls finally broke us out of that black channel and closed us over that and the daily 8/20ema. We however did hit a brick wall at 4000. 4000 if you look at the chart is definitely a major pivot point. If the bulls can close us over 4000 tomorrow that really should open up a push back to 4055-4095. However, if the bears can hold futures under 4000 at close and turn this into a double top I would target a retest of 3955.

Bulls minimally want a closure over 3970 tomorrow but ideally would like a closure over 4020. If the bears can break this back under 3955 tomorrow that would be an important level to signify possible downside for next week. 

Futures level:  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3895 -> 4095  
 Daily Support- 3975 -> 3955 -> 3920  
 Daily Resistance- 4000 -> 4020 -> 4055

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e5rlquvtd6oa1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b304c9b18958b77a075e3cd7dd1595d48b6477f

The VIX continues to have extreme volatility and movement. For most of the day the VIX was able to hold that key 23.65 support level. However, by EOD it lost that support and now has closed back under its daily 8ema. Last support is at the 22 level which is the daily 20ema. However, with this bearish engulfing VIX candle this truly unless we get another double bottom is a bullish omen for the markets as a whole. 

As much as I do like downside and do believe that we wont see the 420s for a while… this black swan event has significantly fizzled out and for now is not going to be enough to take us down all the way. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oag0toaud6oa1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77bb414dd42eb8a7c768f9604d80c84f17f85281

The dollar really didn’t do a whole lot of anything today… it just sort of fizzled around. However, it should be noted that it did not break through that 104.6 level but it also did not break back under the 104.3 support area. 

As you can see much like SPY there is a breakout triangle here on DXY… last time DXY/ 10YR set up a pattern with SPY when they broke SPY followed… keeping a close eye here on DXY to see which way it goes. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g5kwnmpud6oa1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=07548ae5328dc4c8c99583631060713bd0ac9548

The 10YR is finding “support” as in we have finally found a level mostly on SPY and a level of fear that people would rather take a risk in the markets then they would in bonds. 

This shows me today and I mentioned this is what happened on Tuesday also that the “fear” unwound and people left the safety of the bond market. Now the interesting thing here is that the very next day as you can see fear immediately spiked. So while we have now put out the first for Credit Suisse and now apparently FRC… there are many banks left that are still not in a good place. I actually would not be surprised tomorrow to see the 10yr rate drop again due to some new fear. 

This 3.39% area is where even back to January and February we seem to see the pivot from safety back to risk on. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9p5wc4vd6oa1.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb70cab3ca25ea8712c05a88dcb47a1495b6b34d

I actually talked about this a little bit yesterday but I mentioned that TECH as a whole looked incredibly stronger than SPY looked. Why is that? Well in my opinion people think tech is beaten down over the last year. People thing that “big tech” is too big too fall and that there is safety in TECH. Now is a company like Apple, Msft, or google going to go out of business? Absolutely not (probably) as long as the CEO doesn’t do something absolutely stupid… 

However, are these companies “fool proof” and “recession proof?” Absolutely not. For instance, the last true recession in 07-09 the Nasdaq actually fell 56% and SPY fell 57%. Which is quite interesting because year to date through end of February the NASD is actually up 9.5% compared to 3.7% for SPY. 

Who has more room to fall in a true market crash/ recession? 

Now some more perspective here is that 10 years post the 07/09 recession Apple was up 900%, Amazon 2000%, MSFT 400% and even Netflix was up 5000%+. So in a way it does make sense to see people pile into these tech giants because well some day they’ll get their investment back.. however, its like they always say… tech is the last domino to fall… This sudden rush to tech very well could be the final signal. 

For now it appears we have avoided the black swan and financial collapse of 2023… however, like anything nothing happens immediately and its never straight down… ive said since 2022 that the bottom (outside of a black swan event) is likely in and I have also said we are unlike to see any significant new 52 week high until at least 2025. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ov0ho7lvd6oa1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d3bb29252eae9827443bf271a540b194edb5a1b

Honestly today was just an annoying trading day. Just ended up trading against myself and catching every stop loss hunt it seems. I wasn’t able to rid any of that massive ride up from 1015 to 1145. I attempted to time a reversal only to get stopped out. 

From there I was able to grab quite a few small wins and at one point had even crawled myself back to breakeven. Only to get stop loss hunted twice on calls. 

Days like today (and really yesterday) are highly frustrating for me to trade. Today was not a technical based rally it wasn’t even momentum it was algo fueled FOMO pushing us higher on “good” news. Days like the last two days are nearly impossible to trade well (at least for my established and well tested strategy) because it does not truly follow technical. 

Was there money to be made? Yes… did I have some wins? Absolutely. But I honestly woulda been better off just stopping after my first two trades of the day when I saw that massive 1015 to 1145 am rally and realized what type of day we were going to have…

One thing that I always preach is that we do not have to trade every day. We also do not have to trade every single set up. If you have a well established strategy that you have tried in numerous markets… you learn the limits of that strategy. For me today I knew I was pushing my limit of my strategy. While I did put in a small red day I have had a good enough rest of the week to make up for it and still look to close out another green week. 

However, one thing I definitely recommend is if you can tell… which I mentioned very early on that I knew this was going to be a tough day to trade for my strategy/rules… there is nothing wrong with taking the day off. Remember there are 252 trading days in a year.. you are better off walking away with a small loss or even net zero day versus over trading and putting yourself in a position that will take longer to recover and get back into the green.",DaddyDersch,2,1.0,5,0,0,5,12,2023-03-16T22:13:56Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11t80q0/incognito_qe_and_quad_witching_day_31623_spy_es/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

11sc46l,DD,Carlos Santana and Friends Solve Banking Crisis,"The egg bar was bustling with customers, but Crixus, C-3PO, and Carlos Santana were deep in conversation at a corner table, discussing the banking crisis that had been plaguing the city.

Crixus, the undefeated Gaul, was the first to speak. ""I've seen many battles in my time, but this banking crisis is a formidable foe. We need a plan, and fast.""

C-3PO, the protocol droid, chimed in, ""I believe the key to solving this crisis lies in analyzing the data and understanding the root cause of the problem.""

Carlos Santana, the renowned musician, nodded in agreement. ""I hear you, C-3PO. But we also need to bring a human touch to this crisis. The people who are affected by this crisis need to know that we understand their pain and we're here to help.""

Crixus furrowed his brow in thought. ""But how do we do that? The banks are too big to fail, and the people are too small to succeed.""

Carlos Santana leaned in, a glint in his eye. ""We need to make it smooth. We need to bring harmony to this crisis.""

C-3PO tilted his head in confusion. ""I'm not sure I understand, Mr. Santana. How do we bring harmony to a banking crisis?""

Carlos Santana smiled. ""Through music, my friend. Through music. We can organize a benefit concert, where all the proceeds go towards helping the people affected by this crisis. We can bring people together, and through music, we can heal the wounds caused by this crisis.""

Crixus nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. ""I like the sound of that. Music has always been a unifying force. And if we can bring people together, we can create a movement that demands change.""

C-3PO added, ""And we can use the data we've gathered to create policies and regulations that prevent this crisis from happening again in the future.""

The three of them continued to brainstorm ideas, fueled by the delicious egg bars and the energetic atmosphere of the egg bar. They knew that the banking crisis was a tough opponent, but they were determined to bring harmony to the chaos, just like the smooth sound of Carlos Santana's music.",Velocirapper0311,18,0.69,11,0,0,11,0,2023-03-15T22:50:47Z,False,False,t2_bhxh4sds,110,469,1,12,2021-04-12T19:21:49Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11sc46l/carlos_santana_and_friends_solve_banking_crisis/

11s96uk,DD,"Why SVB is just the beginning: Part II Eurodollar edition, from a investment analyst","last week I wrote about why the SVB failure is tied to the fall in bond prices caused by the fed rate hikes, imbuing 4-6 trillion in bond losses globally, around 1 trillion of which fell on the banking sector.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11obkuc/why\_svb\_is\_just\_the\_beginning\_analysis\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11obkuc/why_svb_is_just_the_beginning_analysis_of_the/)

Today, I will be talking about why bank failures are on the way, and it will cause a global deflationary malaise in which central banks cannot quickly respond to.

First things first, the big four US major banks are not going to fail, they are effective government-run utilities at this point. The size of the total Banking sector in the US is close to USD23 trillion. This is relatively safe, it is heavily regulated, most of which is FDIC insured. There may be some runs on the smaller banks, but I don't expect the second stage of the crisis to come from here.

https://preview.redd.it/hi0e3ilw1xna1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2445ffd24bdc1993cb3f7e1ba4e54e2617c59de

But there is a large banking system outside of the united states, and almost all of it is dealing in dollars.  This is the Eurodollar market. 95+% of global trade is done using USD, and so if I am a Korean car manufacturer that needs to borrow dollars to finance the purchase of steel from China, I borrow in dollars from Korean bank, which mayble has a swap agreement with HSBC or a Panamanian bank from my local operating currrency into dollars. The entire system is hidden from view is the size of it is estimated to be anywhere from USD30 to 50 trillion and it finances almost the entire global supply chain.

And the stresses on this system is extreme and is happening on two levels.

First on the domestic US level, The FRA-OSIS spread is at a higher level today than doing the depth of the covid crash in 2020. It is at 70 today. This measures the spread between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate. the FRA represents market expectation of future borrowing costs for banks versus the OIS which is the current borrowing cost for banks. And it blowing out to the highest level since Lehman is that market participants anticipate large credit risks coming out of the banking system. When the Fed came out with the backstop of deposit, what is very surprising is that the FRA-OIS spread continued to open up, instead of going back down. It is a sign that banks are starting to be wery of lending to each other.

https://preview.redd.it/ek9cvphknyna1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b463fa3060bf4892319153d09225fc16cc30e416

At the same time, Eurodollar futures spiked at a larger than that after when Lehamn brothers failed. Remember, eurodollar futures are demand for dollars stored ""OUTSIDE"" of the united states. This shows massive bid for dollar deposits outside of the United States.

https://preview.redd.it/ezm6440noyna1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7df205cb12e8245d9e934ae910d049aecba7882

So what does this mean? See, the fed could bail out the US banking system, so any further deterioration of the US banking system I think will be limited, although you could still have some regional banks fail and be managed by the FDIC. But the big US banks are getting very very nervous and percieving credit risks and not lending. This will led to high costs for interbank lending. But where the riskiest part of this chain is where it then links up to the Eurodollar market. What happens if overseas bank start defaulting on dollar loans that they have on their balance sheet? Who will come to their rescure?

What happens if those offshore money center banks start facing deposit runs because the loans they gave out in dollars are probably going to see defaults? Afterall, if you do have dollars, why would you put them into a 0% deposit no insurance panamanian bank, especially if there is no FDIC covering those deposits. No, you would want to get it into the US to earn 4-5% in treasuries and money market. So dollars deposited in these offshore banks have been decreasing all year.

This is why you are seeing pressure on Credit Suisse and DB and HSBC, because they are large global money center banks. What happens if these global banks collapse because they cannot attract enough dollar funding? Well, they would bid the hell out of dollar deposits, which is what we are seeing through the eurodollar futures, and once the collapse happens, it would look like the great depression 2.0 as 20-40 trillion of lent-out ""Dollars"" simply vanish in the blink of an eye.

So the threat of a global deflationary collapse is very much real, and we are staring at its mutation from the US to the Eurodollar market.",vegaseller,139,0.91,261,0,1,261,3,2023-03-15T21:02:59Z,False,False,t2_76s5t,547,9082,358,7700,2012-03-16T18:31:25Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11s96uk/why_svb_is_just_the_beginning_part_ii_eurodollar/

Now mid day we had the Swiss say basically that CS was “too big to fail.” We then had a $4 pump on one candle. I do not think I have ever seen a $4 15minute candle outside of FOMC or other market breaking news. That was one impressive recovery…

Something that was very interestingly noted this morning was that the 2y/3m yields inverted for the first time since January 2001.. as you can see that led to a surprise 50bps CUT by the fed and also a massive 4.8% green day when they did that… IF we get a cut tomorrow I would 100% ride a 0dte call to glory…   
 

Now do I think we get a surprise cut? No not really… especially with data tomorrow and Friday to come still and FOMC being next week already… I am still not convinced we get a fed pause at FOMC Wednesday still…

Honestly something that is pretty interesting today is how strong some of TECH was… the top dogs all finished green outside of Tesla today… Incredibly the Nasdaq still closed a red day though… Looking at the sell pressure/ breath of SPY, NASD and NYSE it is very clear that there was a heavy rotation out of NYSE into SPY/ NASD today. 

I understand a rotation out of the banking sector right now and I suppose that money has to flow somewhere… however, I find it a little bit odd to pile into TECH in a situation like this. To me big tech is not “safe” money nor is it somewhere you should be looking to put your money IF there truly is a bank run/ financial crisis happening before our eyes… Very interesting to watch today and watching VOLD. 

The fact that SPY was able to close over its opening price today with the constant sell pressure that VOLD (NYSE) had all day is incredibly impressive. Even VOLSPD (S&P500) had constant sell pressure most of the day… There was so many rogue bounces and rogue candles today that were hard to explain. Today of the last 5 tradings days (since the bank run issues) was definitely the hardest to trade. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f0gonpz1vyna1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85ad0979f43d6dd1686b85eadabf8a203acfa393

There is really not much of a supply and demand update today. The biggest thing to note is that we did bounce direction off 385.87 demand once again today. That would re-confirm 385.87 as a strong support and would once again make our upside target 394.68 demand (now resistance). 

The only reason to suspect downside is if we were to establish a new supply (resistance) short of 405.17. According to the technical we are in the process of doing just that within the next few trading days. IF tomorrow closes under 385 we realistically will most likely establish a new supply (resistance) at 389.42. 

We are in a holding pattern from a S/D stand point. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ej8ukaj2vyna1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8375d40c5b4ae34c94f33276a85f3ac2f10e859a

We once again find ourselves in a blue falling wedge on the SPY daily. This falling wedge seems to get re-written every day for the last few days. This tells me that price action really is undecisive here. Actually if you look at the last 4 days of trading candle wise this reminds me a lot of February 22nd to February 27th. 

There realistically is not enough data to know where we are headed next… And honestly anyone who claims “I KNEW we were going to retest 383-385 today…” “Or I knew we wouldn’t hold over 390 after yesterday.” Is a big fat liar. Yes from a technical stand point we can 100% call out levels and regardless of technical or news driven we will eventually hit a level… however, we are 100% in a news driven market with the banking issues and fed funds rates right now. None of today was predictable unless you some how had insider news on CS. Just like no one could have predicted SPY would put in a $4 green candle at 215pm today… 

Anyone swinging options in this market is crazy if you ask me. One tweet is all it takes to send this market tumbling or rumbling. IT 100% is best to sit cash and play whats in front of us… 

The biggest things to watch for tomorrow is this falling wedge. Resistance will be at 387.9 tomorrow. Which means unless we open red and hold red all day we will break that resistance for the falling wedge which should open the upside. With that falling wedge being broken bulls will once again attempt to take back 390.1 pivot point. However, if the bulls either reject the falling wedge or reject 390.1 pivot point tomorrow then we are very likely going to see a sell off back into the low 380s if not 370s. 

This market is what I would call extremely fragile right now. Everyone is 100% on edge right now and no one knows whats going to happen in the next week, month or year… and there is a lot of big money that is getting nervous. With the fact that we had our 4th 150mil+ volume day in a row for the first time since may 2022 there is A LOT of trading happening behind the scenes. Tread lightly. 

SPY Levels:  
 Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 376.67 -> 385.87 -> 394.68  
 Daily Support- 385.9 -> 381.8  
 Daily Resistance- 390.2 -> 391.8 -> 394.7

Much like SPY there just isn’t much going on yet. However, technical fully support that we are about to see a new supply (resistance) put in. IF we were to close red tomorrow and especially close under 3895 we most likely will establish 3955 as supply (resistance). IF you look at the last 3 trading days they all hard rejected attempts to breakout and close over that level. 

IF we see 3955 established as a new supply (resistance) that would be an incredibly strong resistance that is going to take a lot of effort to break through. That would open up the potential for downside to 3833. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vxcgvhm3vyna1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95611dc5b4559aa944d26628e1d35aa0de472d8e

Here on futures I have highlighted this black range from 3888 to 3955 which 5 of the last 5 tradings days has closed within. This is a major level that we have currently established as consolidation. 

The markets here are consolidating waiting for the next move. Futures also has a red falling wedge formed that too keeps getting the goal post moved almost every day it seems. That resistance lies at 3948. 

Currently futures is attempting to close over key 3920 pivot point. After this double top off 3955 we should have and did get downside. The question now is will this double top turn around and immediately form a double bottom? 

If bulls can retake the day tomorrow we will need to take out and most importantly close over 3955 in order to see continuation. If there is a rejection and closure under 3955 again tomorrow I would 100% expect a retrace back to 3888 area. 

Futures levels:  
 Supply- 4055  
 Demand- 3833 -> 3895 -> 4095  
 Daily Support- 3920 -> 3888 -> 3870 -> 3829  
 Daily Resistance- 3955 -> 3990

The VIX has been absolutely on the move the last 5 trading days. Seems to be that anytime the VIX crosses that 26.9 area we get a huge retracement. The VIX is clearly remaining elevated here as people are piling into those longer term protections. 

&#x200B;

The FG index officially hit 19 today. The last time the FG hit 19 was on October 12th. At that time the VIX was trading $33-$35 and SPY was trading $356 to $359 area.

The Dollar actually got a really big bounce today closing back in that 104.7 area. With this big bounce off that 103.6 area we are now trading back in the 104.6 to 105.1 consolidation range we spent most of march trading within. 

**10YR YIELD**

Realistically not too surprising with the CS news this morning we had a massive rate drop on the 10yr today. There was a ton of money that piled into the safety of bonds/ yields today. 

The question remains what happens next? We saw a similar situation on Monday and the next day the 10yr shot right back up as people piled back into the market on Tuesday with the good CPI read. If there is no new “good” data like CPI (though I will say the PPI reading was REALLY good this morning) is there enough reason to get people out of the 10yr and back into the market? 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Today ended up being a green day but honestly today was a pretty frustrating trading day. There was many times where we would have everything lined up for the perfect put opportunity and we would even have price action breaking through key levels that generally signal a good put opportunity only for price action to take a hard $2 reversal. 

I don’t know if I have ever seen so many $1 one minute candle reversals. Today was very difficult to trade as I felt like price action was moving so aggressively for one and so erratically for two that it was very difficult to “stay ahead.” This week and some of last I started using breakeven stops and setting profitable stop losses (generally 5%) which saved me numerous times from some of these incredible reversals we had. 

Todays price action compared to the last 5 days felt very artificial and unpredictable.

11rxdvn,DD,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #030: Billions Into Biotech, Billionaires Buy More Oil | Insider Trading Recap","GM,

**TL;DR** \- Transactions tapered off from last week (-28%) despite a larger number of insiders filing Form 4s this past week (+96% / 1,266 total). Purchases were spearheaded by a nearly $1.4B purchase by Sumitomo Chemicals Co, a 10% owner of Myovant Sciences Ltd ($MYOV / Biotechnology).

In last week's update, we mentioned that Buffett increased his stake in $OXY by \~3%. This week, fellow billionaire Carl Icahn increased his stake in $SWX by 35.3%.

Is the oil rush here? The ConocoPhillips Willow project was recently approved by the Biden administration. Maybe that's a sign of more deals to come. 

Anyone with a POV on Oil & Gas, drop some knowledge for us in the comments.

&#x200B;

Below are some notable buys from insiders:

* Icahn Partners Master Fund increased their stake in Southwest Gas Holdings ($SWX / Gas Utilities) by 35.28% with a $140M purchase on March 10th
* Thilo Schroeder, a Director at Revolution Medicines ($RVMD / Biotechnology) increased their position by 216% with a $14M purchase on March 7th
* Erik Ragatz, a Director at Grocery Outlet Holding Corp ($GO / ) established a position with a $2.5M purchase on March 6th

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $622M to $1.49B (+140%)
* Sales increased from $4.4B to $6.1B (+38%)
* Transactions decreased from 1,290 to 923 (-28%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 356 to 663 (+86%)
   * Net buyers increased from 39 to 56 (+44%)
   * Net sellers increased from 317 to 607 (+91%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 647 to 1,266 (+96%)
   * Net buyers increased from 48 to 85 (+77%)
   * Net sellers increased from 599 to 1,181 (+97%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **March 6th - March 10th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **February 27th - March 6th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind[ Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

11rv9ar,DD,Charles Schwab and GE,"Alright gather round little regards.

I'm not going to lie to you. Charles Schwab is my brokerage. But let me tell you all the story of general electric in 2008.

In the early 2000s GE made their money mostly through GE capital which was their finance and lending arm. They leveraged the good name of GE and the manufacturing arm to build a truly sizable lending program. That all fell apart doing the 2008 financial crisis Aland they had bad loans on their books for years and years after the fact and ended up having to secure funding from Warren Buffett himself.

History doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes.

Charles Schwab is currently and has been moving more and more into the investor checking and other investor lending programs. Using their brokerage good will and name as their backdrop. Personal example: Over the last 10 years I've gone from using just their brokerage account to now having checking and other related accounts with them. While the investor checking and other banking functions are a small portion of their business, I'm fearful at this point that they did not properly invest their banking funds and it could might pull the entire business down.

Between Schwab and credit suisse we're staring down the next domino's to fall and see how they get sorted out.

Credit suisse is a wild card we don't know how the swiss will back up their bank, and it won't look good or feel good to the tax payer if we do it for them.

11regit,DD,STNE earnings preview: Best of both worlds: Growth and Margin of Safety,"Do you like the Oracle of Omaha? Do you like ‘Money Tree’ Cathie Wood? Do you love both?

Have I got the company for you! Here’s the press release teaser showing the company goes up or down 20% on earnings, which is tonight! Growth has been annualized at 68% over the last 5 years. 

**StoneCo** (NASDAQ:STNE) is set to give its latest quarterly earnings report on Tuesday, 2023-03-14. Here's what investors need to know before the announcement.

Analysts estimate that StoneCo will report an **earnings per share** (EPS) of $0.12.

StoneCo bulls will hope to hear the company announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter.

New investors should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast).

Historical Earnings Performance

Last quarter the company beat EPS by $0.04, which was followed by a 16.82% increase in the share price the next day.

Here's a look at StoneCo's past performance and the resulting price change:

**Quarter** **Q3 2022** **Q2 2022** **Q1 2022** **Q4 2021**

**EPS Estimate** 0.06 0.02 0.04 -0.06

**EPS Actual** 0.10 0.05 0.08 0.02

**Price Change %** 16.82% -22.3% 13.24% 42.04%

Insights: Brazil is having a large movement for their 214 million citizens into use of credit cards and digital payments. StoneCo is a part of this movement and by many measures stands to gain the most market share over time. They offer CRM products like Salesforce, pay over time products like Affirm and also payroll services like Rippling. The combination of CRM with payroll through a single provider is currently proprietary and is an edge they have over the larger players in Brazil. Those larger players are priced for perfection based on my cash flow analysis. StoneCo appears to give \~150% factor of safety with modest growth assumptions. If (when) they start to take market share after the saturation in Brazil for digital payments is complete, that would be remarkable growth that isn’t factored into baseline assumptions. They had a decline after peaking at $90 a share because of a bad bet by the company, and they owned up to it quickly. Their earnings have suffered, but are coming back to the 30% profit margin they had before the bad bet.

TL/DR: Profit margin (cash flow) is going up like Buffet’s moat-like companies 🚀🚀🚀, revenue growth is growing like Cathie Wood’s typical companies that don't make money🚀🚀🚀, and it’s valued as if there is no future revenue growth for your margin of safety. Hold on to your bippy as this rocket gets lit tonight.🚀🚀🚀

First Republic bank looks like yet another casualty of the regional bank contagion.

The stock is -60% in the pre-market and the reason why its imploding is because it actually can't benefit from the FED+FDIC new bail-out facility.

You need Treasuries and MBS to tap the facility, and $FRC has almost none.

11pwtsz,DD,I Learned How the Bank Bailout Works,"**TL; DR for Children**

Imagine you and your friends have a lemonade stand, but you run out of money to buy more lemons and cups. The Bank Term Funding Program is like your mom giving you some money to buy what you need so you can keep selling lemonade. The banks borrow money from the government when they need it, so they can keep lending money to people and help the economy stay strong. It's like a safety net to make sure the banks don't run out of money and people can still borrow money when they need it.

**TL; DR for Adults**

The bailout is not called TARP this time it is called BTFP. The Federal Reserve has a program called the Bank Term Funding Program that helps banks, credit unions, and other types of financial institutions in the United States get money when they need it. They can borrow money from the Federal Reserve Banks by using certain types of securities, like stocks or bonds, as collateral. The program is available to banks that are doing well financially and the interest rate is set at a reasonable fixed rate. The Department of the Treasury provides a safety net in case any of the institutions that borrowed money can't pay it back. This program is a way to make sure there is enough money in the economy and it will be available until at least March 11, 2024.

## If My Grandma Mother Had a Failing Bank, I’d Explain the Above Picture to Her Like This

Grandma, the Bank Term Funding Program is a program that helps banks, credit unions, and other types of financial institutions in the United States get money when they need it.

The program allows these institutions to borrow money from the Federal Reserve Banks by using certain types of securities, like stocks or bonds, as collateral.

The program is available to any U.S. federally insured depository institution that is eligible for primary credit, meaning that they are in good financial standing. The amount that a financial institution can borrow is limited to the value of the securities that they use as collateral.

The interest rate for the program is set at a fixed rate that is based on the one-year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points. The program lasts for up to one year, and there are no fees associated with it.

The Department of the Treasury provides credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, which means that the banks have a safety net in case any of the institutions that borrowed money under the program are not able to pay it back.

The program is available until at least March 11, 2024, and borrowers can prepay their loans at any time without penalty.

## SVB & Signature Bank Failed If You Didn’t Know, Again I’d Explain to My Grandma Like This

Grandma, the Federal Reserve Board has announced that it will provide additional funding to eligible banks and financial institutions to help them meet the needs of their depositors and ensure that money and credit continue to flow in the economy.

To do this, the Federal Reserve will create a new program called the Bank Term Funding Program, which will offer loans of up to one year in length to eligible institutions pledging certain types of assets as collateral. This program will be backed up by the Department of the Treasury, which will make up to $25 billion available as a safety net, although the Federal Reserve doesn't expect to need this money.

The Federal Reserve is also working closely with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and is monitoring the financial system closely to ensure it remains stable.

Banks and financial institutions can also get liquidity from the Federal Reserve through the discount window, which is available to them. The Federal Reserve is ready to take additional steps to support households and businesses if necessary.

## What Happens Next

The Bank Term Funding Program is a valuable resource for financial institutions in need of funding, and it can be accessed by pledging certain types of securities as collateral. It's good to know that the program is available to U.S. federally insured depository institutions that are in good financial standing and that the interest rate is fixed and reasonable.

Additionally, the Department of the Treasury provides credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, which means that banks have a safety net if they are unable to repay the loan.

The Federal Reserve Board is also committed to supporting eligible banks and financial institutions by providing additional funding, and the Bank Term Funding Program is one of the tools it will use to ensure that money and credit continue to flow in the economy. It's reassuring to know that the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the financial system to ensure its stability and is ready to take additional steps to support households and businesses if necessary.

In conclusion, the Bank Term Funding Program is a vital resource for U.S. financial institutions in need of immediate funds.

It allows these institutions to borrow money from the Federal Reserve Banks using securities as collateral, with a fixed interest rate and no fees.

The Department of the Treasury provides credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, and the program is available until at least March 11, 2024, giving eligible institutions a safety net in case of financial difficulty.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the financial system and working with the FDIC to protect depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The Fed is also prepared to take additional steps to support households and businesses if necessary.",Frequent-Ebb6310,46,0.7,20,0,0,20,1,2023-03-13T01:56:06Z,Edited,False,t2_vz2ael88,10000,10000,140,4706,2023-02-21T18:27:06Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11pwtsz/i_learned_how_the_bank_bailout_works/

11p7kwk,DD,Autohellas S.A. (ATH:OTOEL) Has A ROE Of 21%,"While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Autohellas S.A. ([ATH:OTOEL](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares)), by way of a worked example.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

[View the latest analysis for Autohellas](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares)

## How Is ROE Calculated?

**Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:**

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Autohellas is:

21% = €78m ÷ €371m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each €1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made €0.21 in profit.

## Does Autohellas Have A Good ROE?

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Autohellas has an ROE that is roughly in line with the [Retail Distributors industry](https://simplywall.st/markets/gr/consumer-discretionary/retail-distributors) average (18%).

&#x200B;

[    ](https://preview.redd.it/x86tborl69na1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=443e4c75c3537924eeee3f13497b3292a4df79d0)

That's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Autohellas you can see here at the [risks dashboard.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares)

## The Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity

Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.

## Autohellas' Debt And Its 21% ROE

Autohellas does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.39. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

## Conclusion

Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In my books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.

But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this [report on analyst forecasts for the company](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/retail/ath-otoel/autohellas-shares/future).",6_zeros,7,0.5,0,0,0,0,1,2023-03-12T06:36:25Z,False,False,t2_ur16eaqp,177,123,2,1,2022-12-04T08:39:12Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11p7kwk/autohellas_sa_athotoel_has_a_roe_of_21/

11od685,DD,"Okay Fellas, Im going to tell you how to take advantage of this news, Inverse the fear. $BX","Blackstone has taken a hit lately, this is a mix of fear on top of sector risk, on top of misunderstood news. These are the big sharks in the water and they are taking advantage of those who are struggling.

They recently defaulted on a bond, this seems bearish (it is for the economy), but not for BX. This is where the big money really starts to fuk around with everyone, liquidity is king and gets to negotiate when things start to break. This is complex multi-layer bond stuff that I don't feel like writing about but this Bloomberg video explains it best.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/blackstone-defaults-on-531-million-nordic-property-backed-cmbs#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/blackstone-defaults-on-531-million-nordic-property-backed-cmbs#xj4y7vzkg)

Blackstone has kept 20% of their money liquid (about $190 Billion) with another 20B that has been liquidated about a week ago in Bumble, the London stock exchange, and other GBP assets waiting for this.

The big dogs are about to put pressure on those that are struggling and will come out the other side of any real turmoil fatter and more asset-heavy than they were before. They have specifically noted on the front page of the last 2 quarters the amount of liquidity they have right now. We are not talking about regional banks, we are talking about Trillions, not the billions, and GLOBAL.

These guys went public holding all real estate days before the GFC and came out the other side.

The government moves slowly, SVB needs liquidity fast for payroll and it looks like BX & Apollo are coming to the rescue over the weekend, they are going to be ruthless in a fire sale.

On a macro level, these cracks will also lead to a pause or at least a .25 hike.

The bottom line, what is bearish for the small fish is bullish for the whales, negotiations will be an extremely uphill battle for anyone that is struggling. BX is deep in political connections, not talking SBF donations to parties, I’m talking dinners with presidents, globally.

11obkuc,DD,"Why SVB is just the beginning, Analysis of the fall of SVB from a Financial Analyst","Ignore the headlines and news anchor, they don't really understand shit. But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.

From the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.

For example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.

Most people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.

https://preview.redd.it/nuaouidc91na1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd1df457bbc1c8521213d752cb72fcfdfc74edc8

With the sudden spike up in rates over the last 12-16 months, the mark to market losses of the bond market is probably somewhere to the tune of 4-6 trillion. And I have always been wondering where that was going to show up and blow something up in the financial market. And the answer is in the banks.

Don't believe what they tell you, Silicon Valley Bank was a very conservative bank. Out of their \~200 billion in assets, very little (<0.5%) was venture debt lending. As you can see in their Q4 Balance Sheet, they had 15 billion in cash/cash like securities, about 120 billion investment securities and 70 billion in loans.

https://preview.redd.it/1txj1mjma1na1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5db030273760e55e735cbe23f59f7bdc234c4ba6

within that 120 billion investment securities, it is almost entirely treasuries and Agency MBS/CMO and CMBS with a touch of muni bonds. You can't build a more conservative book if you tried. As these are all effective government securities as the GSEs are still in conservatorship under the treasury. For years due to Basel III, US banks have been derisking and now most of their balance sheets consists of government or quasi government securites which have almost no default risks.

https://preview.redd.it/lsa5410ab1na1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08f812017cc1f95d3bb9744f7d63a150d9af5980

Now looking at the loan book, you can see the bulk of it is in global fund banking and investor dependent. Global Fund banking is an extremely safe segment, it consists of largely funding or bridging loans to venture capitalist making transactions. So for example if a VC  wants to invest in company A, but they want to wait 2 months before drawing down from their LPs, they will go to SVB to get a credit line for this purpose. This is an extremely safe business model as Venture/PE Funding is contracted funding and there has been basically no defaults on these types of loans ever in history. Then you have private bank, which consisted of lending to rich people over collateralized through the value of their houses, which is also a pretty safe business model as their asset coverage typically exceeds 150% of the loan value.

Even the investor dependent segment is typically very safe book, as they will write loans as simply a bridge when a financing round for the company has already closed, but are still waiting a few months for the all the papers to be signed and the funds to be transfered.

So wtf is happening, this is a bank that is holding like 2/3 of its book in government papers and the rest in fairly safe lending. The speculative lending to early tech business represent <0.5% of the book.

The answer is the federal reserve, this guy

https://preview.redd.it/55mo4dswd1na1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d709bd4f520d27a18147429f343a3a24ce45dcb3

He basically fucked over the entire banking sector. Remember that 120 billion in agency backed papers  and treasuries in the investment securities section of SVB , well, most of that is HTM (Hold to Maturnity). Its a bank, get over it, a duration mismatch is expected. But the amplitute of the loss is proportional to the raise in rates due simply how bonds work. In the SVB book, the average maturity is around 6 years. Some simple math point to about a 10% loss in this investment book that hasn't been marked to market, representing about 12 billion in losses. This wiped out all the equity of the bank and some of the  value of the bonds.

Overall the Agency papers and treasuries can be sold over the course of the next couple of weeks and depositers will get about 60 cents on the dollar and the remainder will be sold over the next 12-48 months and I expect most depositers to get back close to 90 cents + on the dollar.

Well that's great, you might say. NO, IT IS NOT GREAT. BECAUSE SVB was not a bad bank, it was actually a pretty conservative bank. It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers. Marry that to the game theory dynamics of the low cost of getting your money out first so you can meet payroll mean't that once it starts, you can't stop it.

Ok, you ask, what the hell does it all mean for the future. Well, here is the thing. If SVB is underwater, are all the banks are underwater?

Here are the assets of JPM, again, for the major banks, JPM has a 3.5 trillion balance sheet, and BOA has a 3 trillion balance sheet. JPM only lists out 641 billion of that 3.5 trillion as trading securities and thus and they reported a loss of \~50 billion or \~8%.

https://preview.redd.it/pskuutvch1na1.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b2440e41969af319d6b7c38f0ad887e9684533d7

This is a similar picture with BOA, which lists out trading securites of 300 billion, but there is another 2.7 billion in other assets, of which 1 trillion are longer dated treasuries and agency securities. If we mark to market those losses, there is another 80-100 billion in losses which are not being marked to market.

https://preview.redd.it/gwn7vmluk1na1.png?width=1775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aff904456f63c469680d9b96f45cf06327e4dae

Again, going back to the original thought, someone lost 4-6 trillion through the bond market from fed raising rates. Close to 2 trillion is lost through agency securities with the reminder from treasuries. Unironically, close to 15% of this is lost from the fed itself, due to its own balance sheet of treasuries and agency papers. It looks like around 30% of those agency security losses or about \~600 billion is through the commerical banks. I suspect probably another 300-400 billion though treasuries. So the banking sector has lost about 1 trillion in the past year, of which only maybe 100-200 billion has actually been marked-to-market down as losses.

Remember, the size of the losses in Subprime was only about \~100 billion. Now, every 50 bps increase by the fed results in close to that much in losses to the banking sector. So yes, Mr. Powell wil likely blow up the entire banking system.

https://preview.redd.it/rc3npwezm1na1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b129ee19c69c5e14ef3be6410b3c5da580c943c2

Edit 1: Alot of people are pointing out that the deposit base of other banks are signficantly different. Yes 100% agree, but the run on liquidity of a bank can come in two ways. One is on the deposit side (see great depression and SVB), the other way is through the interbank funding market (alas 2008). I will write a part II in the coming days of the drying up of that source of liqudity.

Edit 2: Also a lot of people keep pointing to hedging and managing duration risk. This is BS as all the banks have this unrealized loss on their balance sheet, go look.Imagine God telling everyone he is going to destroy your house, now go and try to find insurance on your house for less than the cost of building a new house. And to the smart asses mentioning swaps. Go ahead and try to swap your house for a new house for anything less 0. Now think termites slowly destroying your house over the course of a year instead an earthquake, good luck being the person trying to hedge that. But the most relevant point is that a security that is classified under the HTM category, it cannot have any hedges. So to all the people who think this was a risk management issue, go look at all the other banks, they have not hedged their HTM securties either. To compound this, the fed in 2021 signaled very strongly to market that rates were going to held at zero until 2024, and then pivoted in 12 months, throwing everyone in for a loop. There was no realistic way for any management or risk management team to have handled this. So yes, the blame lies largely with the fed here.

Edit 3: on all the people saying the larger banks are so much smarter and know what they are doing. SVB had the most liquid portfolio of any bank out there. They had about 8% of their desposits in cash and about \~45% in GSE/treasuries which is the most liquid instrument out there and can be sold down in a weeks notice. None of the other/largest banks are even close to that. The larger banks have a much lower deposit base like \~25%-30% of their capital base and maybe 10-20% in equity and 50-60% are based in interbank financing (hello 2008). The finiky parts of the larger bank's capital structure aren't deposits, most of these are FDIC insured (but still probably only half or so as the business accounts certaintly aren't), it is the intrabank financing part. You know, the stuff that blew up lehman and bear sterns.

Also people don't seem grasp what a bank is and think they should be 100% in cash or something. You do understand banks make money from spreads. Signaling to investors you are taking depositer cash, and investing them in 3-month t-bills yielding 0.25% is a great way to tell them you don't actually have a business model and is a money losing startup like Wework or some shit.",vegaseller,999,0.9,2202,0,10,2202,8,2023-03-11T05:17:55Z,Edited,False,t2_76s5t,547,9082,358,7700,2012-03-16T18:31:25Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11obkuc/why_svb_is_just_the_beginning_analysis_of_the/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

**TL; DR:**

The article covers various economic topics including Medicare solvency, taxes, IRS data transparency, debt, labor market, and inflation. Treasury Secretary Yellen emphasizes the importance of addressing the tax gap, promoting clean energy, and improving infrastructure. The Inflation Reduction Act and increased funding for the IRS aim to support American businesses and ensure fair taxation. While concerns about government spending and inflation persist, there is a need to invest in infrastructure and support households during difficult economic times. **The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year**.

**The Entire Summary of What Actually Happened & What Was Said (*****it was a 3 hour testimony*****)**

Yellen corrected a mistake about the net investment income and stated that extending Medicare solvency is a priority. The budget proposal calls for $4.7 trillion in new taxes, including a small business surtax and an increase in the death tax.

The Ways and Means Committee is looking for signs of a strong labor market and putting Americans back to work. The child tax credit was expanded in the American Rescue Plan to help low-income families hit hard by the pandemic.

ProPublica obtained a trove of IRS data, raising concerns about tax compliance and transparency. The overall debt is $31 trillion, with small businesses being hit hard, especially those with 50 employees or less.

The article covers various topics such as Medicare, audit rates on high-income partnerships, clean and renewable energy, disaster relief, mental health, inflation, Social Security, taxes, bank losses, and the IRS. Secretary of State John Kerry expresses concern about the suffering of the American people, particularly those who depend on Social Security as their major source of income in retirement.

Treasury Secretary Yellen monitors recent developments that concern a few banks and expresses disappointment in the administration's budget proposal, which fails to address the real challenges faced by Americans. The article also mentions a Stanford University report that found black taxpayers are disproportionately audited by the IRS, and the new IRS commissioner promises to report on this issue.

The discussion revolves around various economic policies and proposals presented by different individuals, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, raising corporate tax rates, supply chain problems, the President's budget proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Semiconductor in Chips Act, and the Infrastructure Act.

Some individuals express concerns about deficits, borrowing, inflation, and dependence on other countries, while others emphasize the need to invest in America, create jobs, address issues, and strengthen supply chains. Secretary Yellen also refutes some points made by her colleagues and highlights the importance of closing the tax gap, promoting electric vehicles, and improving infrastructure and digital access.

The witness claimed that inflation would be temporary and brief, but a year later in June 2022, inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1. Dealing with inflation is the number one hardship for many Americans. The committee discussed ways to strengthen economic relations with Taiwan, including negotiating an income tax agreement to reduce double taxation on US and Taiwanese businesses.

The American people need to know that China may not play by the rules, and if necessary, we will tax the income of Chinese companies operating in the United States. The Inflation Reduction Act passed without a single Republican vote and put $80 billion into the IRS to improve its functions. The IRS has answered 90% of its phone calls, squashed its backlog of overdue returns, and introduced new online taxpayer tools.

The number of audits for taxpayers making less than $400,000 may rise if the size of that population goes up. Screening and document matching for those taxpayers will be increased. The administration is seeking to redefine free trade agreements and include tax parity for Indian Health Services scholarships. The budget does not raise taxes on households or small businesses earning less than $400,000 and pays for initiatives by remedying unfairness.

The adoption tax credit faced such a high audit rate and what steps have been taken to address this issue. Additionally, it is important to clarify that the taxes proposed in the president's budget are targeted towards high-income individuals and corporations, not small businesses or individuals earning less than $400,000.

The increase in IRS funding is aimed at improving their ability to serve Americans and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. The Inflation Reduction Act and Treasury's plan to incentivize domestic manufacturing of solar panels are efforts to support American businesses and reduce reliance on foreign imports. While there may be concerns about the impact of government spending on inflation, it is important to consider the benefits of investing in infrastructure and supporting American households during difficult economic times.

The article discusses the US government's debt limit and the recent inflation rates. The Treasury Secretary delayed announcing the debt limit until January 13th due to massive spending packages.

President Biden was not informed by the White House during negotiations. In May 2021, the chairman believed the inflation was temporary and interest rates would remain low. However, in October 2021, he stated that monthly inflation rates would return to levels close to 2. By June 2022, he admitted that he was wrong about the path inflation would take. The US government has always paid its bills, and US treasuries are considered the safest asset in the financial system. The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year.

**Most Bearish Reason They Have for Why This Is Going to Happen by the FED & US Government**

1. The overall debt is $31 trillion, with small businesses being hit hard, especially those with 50 employees or less.
2. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1, and dealing with inflation is the number one hardship for many Americans.
3. The witness claimed that inflation would be temporary and brief, but a year later in June 2022, inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1.
4. The increase in IRS funding is aimed at improving their ability to serve Americans and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes, which could lead to higher tax compliance and potentially higher taxes for some individuals and businesses.
5. The discussion revolves around various economic policies and proposals, with some expressing concerns about deficits, borrowing, inflation, and dependence on other countries.
6. The Treasury Secretary delayed announcing the debt limit until January 13th due to massive spending packages, which could suggest a lack of confidence in the government's ability to manage its finances.
7. The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year, which could negatively impact economic growth and employment.",Frequent-Ebb6310,23,0.73,10,0,0,10,1,2023-03-10T22:26:22Z,Edited,False,t2_vz2ael88,10000,10000,140,4706,2023-02-21T18:27:06Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11o2v86/janet_yellens_complete_testimony_to_the_senate_on/

Depositor Monke get 4.75% from 1M Treasury Monke. Depositor Monke no like Bank Monke, he take money out and give to 1M Treasury Monke. Other Depositor Monke do same thing. But more importantly, many Depositor Monke are VC Monkes that burned lot money last years, so Depositor Monke need money to put into their business, taking money out from Bank Monke.

But problem, Bank Monke no have money on hand to give depositor Monke. He already give Depositor Monke money to Loan Monke and also bought bonds. Uh oh.... Bank Monke cri. Bank Monke know Loan Monkey no have money to give back to him, so only way to get that money is selling his bonds.

But another problem :(. Bond now worth less than what Bank Monke buy for. Bank Monke have no choice but to sell all bonds for a 1.8Bn Loss. Bank Monke also need more cash in case more Depositor Monke do same thing, so on same day Bank Monke also announce sale of his stock.

Also, Bank Monke say this good for Investor Monke because now Bank Monke buy bond that not only pay 1.79% total like bond he sell now. But Investor Monkey mad that Bank Monkey think it was good idea to but long term fixed rate mortgage bonds in a historical low interest rate environment in the first place. Investor Monke mad, Investor Monke sell SIVB stock. This make Depositor Monkes scared, Depositor Monkes gather in a tribe and all pull their money out.

11nsfva,DD,Degen meet Boomer strat: Get Rich or Go Broke,"Ok, Real estate it's awesome, but you need money to get in or you need to be really fucking good at it... this is either a cheat code or a ticket to ""fuck your bank account"". It requires having equity in a home or a really good credit score and friends at the local bank.

I will use home equity for the example. Borrow $50k against your home at 4.5% on a 5 year term.

Your payment will be $900 something.

You throw it all into OUT, an advertising REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust). It pays 7.5% annually higher - earning you higher interest then you are paying.

This is the hard part. You need cashflow to make the payments - if you are short you end up selling some OUT to pay back the loan and you start to cannibalize yourself.

Fuck that cannibalizism is found upon and sucks. So, instead we do the degen strat.

When the market recovers, ad dollars will be flying! So this REIT is positioned to climb back into the $20s.

Let's say it manages to get back to $20 from where it's at right now ($16 and change) in a year. Your OUT position is now worth $62k, plus your compounded reinvested dividends you are looking at paying back that $50k loan and having an $15k free and clear position in OUT making you 7.5% on that $15k every year for the rest of your life.

It only takes being able to make the monthly on the loan, and hitting a little degen luck.

11ndrbd,DD,Unrealized Losses Run Rampant,"Ponder this. Long post, so I apologize ahead of time, but I feel this is an incredibly important topic many should know. For my friends interested in finance. Today’s important topic: Interest Rate Risk. This may not be important to many, but it very well may be soon. 

Per Goldman Sachs, 98% of mortgage loans currently have a rate below 6%, with a super-majority portion of these loans having rates far below today’s prevailing mortgage interest rate of ~7%. The vast majority of these mortgage loans are long duration 30-year fixed, and approximately 65% of these loans are securitized, including being rolled into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Large holders of MBS and other mortgage securities include banks, pension funds, retirement accounts, etc., and of course the Federal Reserve. It is no secret banks especially have acquired large sums of MBS (and other mortgage securities) over the years in their liquidity portfolios. A considerable portion of these holdings are classified on balance sheet as available-for-sale, an important accounting designation in this instance.

Finance 101 dictates that when interest rates rise, bond valuations decline, and vice versa. In this economy, interest rates have risen dramatically from their historically-low trough levels during 2020, 2021, and the first quarter of 2022. The rate of change has been historical. Mortgages are bonds and are particularly rate sensitive, given the long duration nature. Mortgage bond prices are getting smashed. Why does this matter??

The level of unrealized losses in the United States economy tied to mortgages and related securities is absolutely MASSIVE today. These unrealized losses become a tremendous problem if the losses must be recognized, traditionally, via a sale of the assets (or mark to market accounting). With a looming recession on the horizon, this is a glaring potential problem, especially if inflation proves persistent (higher interest rates for longer) and liquidity and credit conditions contract further. 

The risks on the horizon should not be underestimated. Prudent risk management of ones personal and business finances are ever-more crucial today. Interest rate risk is elevated at historical levels, never witnessed by most of us in our lifetimes. It’s important not to fear heightened risk, but to prepare diligently when faced with it. Hopefully this helps someone out there.

   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.

   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

11my1t5,DD,Room-Temperature Superconductivity Claimed – TSM Play,"  

On Wednesday, March 8, 2023, scientists from the University of Rochester claimed to have found evidence of a superconductor that operates at room temperature. 

Like fusion power, room-temperature superconductors are a dream that every scientist and engineer desperately wants to come true. Unlike traditional conductors, which have some inherent resistance, a superconductor is a material with zero resistance, meaning that a current that flows through a superconductor never loses energy. 

Superconductors are already used in applications that require massive currents and magnetic fields, such as MRI machines, which take advantage of superconducting rings that can maintain a circular current that never dies.

Superconductivity is a state of matter in which electrical resistance in a material drops to zero while its electrical and magnetic capacity vastly expands. Assuming it is affordable and able to be made into wire then you could use it for electricity transmission with essentially no loss in power. Currently 5% to 10% of the electricity distributed from generator to consumers is lost to heat from the cables.

Until now, the phenomenon has been observed only at freezing temperatures or unbelievably high pressures. Room temperature semi-conductors could open pathways to lossless electric transmission, high-efficiency electric motors, maglev trains, and low-cost magnets for MRIs and nuclear fusion.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: **TSM**) is a Taiwan-based company mainly engaged in the provision of integrated circuit manufacturing services. They could benefit from this new breakthrough in the scientific community by providing a new product in energy, healthcare, infrastructure, and vehicles. TSM is an integrated circuit manufacturing services include process technology, special process technology, design ecosystem support, mask technology, 3DFabricTM advanced packaging and silicon stacking technology services. TSM has completed the transfer and mass production of 5nm technology, and is engaged in the research and development of 3nm process technology and 2nm process technology. The product application range covers the entire electronic application industry, including personal computers and peripheral products, information application products, wired and wireless communication system products, servers and data centers.

I think TSM will be an unexpected winner of this new scientific breakthrough.

Not financial advice, do your own DD, I eat crayons, so on and so forth.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)

11ma6zv,DD,"Day two of JPOW: chopped up… All eyes on Jobless Claims Tomorrow… 3-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield Daily Market Analysis","Well this has to have been one of the most frustrating days I have traded in a long time. Absolutely zero follow through and some absolutely erratic candle movements chopped me up today. Lets take a look at where the dust has settled… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kboe7u8aclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d12f1d69dc7ae2f46b1678e26fecdf9a538b5f1c

All eyes are officially on jobless claims tomorrow… why is jobless claims tomorrow important? JPOW the last two days has basically re-iterated and other fed talking points have continued to say that we are data dependent and even going into next FOMC we are data dependent. As you cans see by this chart here that we have been trending down on jobless claims (as in there are less and less people saying they are jobless) since December 11th and around the first week of February we “bottomed.” 

The last 3 jobs claims has been higher than previous… why does this matter? Because if job claims are rising now then that would indicate the economy is “weakening” which then means the feds rate hikes are working. The biggest concern for the fed is that despite what they do the economy as it has since summer continues to ramp up. 

This number is projected at 195k tomorrow which would mean a 4th week in a row that claims rise (economy weakening) and that would be extremely bullishly received. However, if that number comes in below 193k again tomorrow that could signal jobs trending back down and the fears of a 50bps grow…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zrqvvwaclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47b3795e8f75c45449b253e81d33ffbed0279abc

As of now… we have a 77.9% priced in chance (expectation) of a 50bps at the march 22nd meeting which I absolutely find incredible. This is where im at…   
 

markets gonna market until CPI -> CPI is going to come in better than expected (aka bullishly received) -> algos are gonna pick up on that and dump the chances of a 50bps to 0% that day… -> massive rally into FOMC -> FOMC becomes the top when the dot plot and fed funds rate projections come out terribly hot and unexpected. 

I don’t think we actually get a 50bps… unless we get a true CPI YoY/ MoM rebound which I don’t forsee, however, I am waiting for the consensus to come out this week still. 

**SPY SUPPLY/ DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gy2z0ahbclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a983b96730035c29843e9257607773176c2bc03b

Today the daily chart came down and touched the 396.54 supply. Now this came within 4 cents on the daily time frame which on a daily time frame is within the room of error. However, this is a key level to keep in mind if we reject the downside. With the current technical on SPY we are actually looking to establish a new demand (support) at this 398.2 range. If we were to put in a green day tomorrow, especially if we could see a close over 401.5 there is a solid chance that today and yesterdays lows establish a new demand (support) at 398.2…. a demand being established over previous demand at 394.68 would be extremely bullish and I would once again start thinking about a push back to the upper range resistance of 405.17. 

Spy very well leading into CPI next week could find itself stuck between a 398 and 405 choppy range. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yh1c6k1cclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd18ecc3b2a050e2c84b40a140ffe8c0f18f8dcb

From a daily price action stand point we have reached a bounce point. This pattern actually is playing out beautifully. If you go back to Thursday we started a three day $12+ pump. It was natural to expect that to result in a retrace to back fill some of these levels. Now that we have back filled the actual daily gap and came down to find support on the daily 100ema… with this morning doji start pattern we should expect a push back to 402 tomorrow minimally. That would put us back at a retest of the daily 20ema. 

Now that’s from strictly a technical standpoint… IF jobs come in low and algos dump us then I would start targeting 394.6 demand area for a potential bounce. 

We have found ourselves exactly where we were on Monday. From a technical/ price action and even supply/ demand stand point this is 100% a call opportunity and I 100% expect upside… however, much like Monday we had a major catalyst that can negate the technical temporarily or can support the technical much like Tuesday did. 

SPY Levels:

Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13   
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily support- 398.4 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  
 Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjygdtmcclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2030405bcd62de1297f254d60312f102fa23ce0f

Taking a look at futures supply and demand we have found ourselves in “no mans land.” We are under the recently established 4055 supply and we are just over the 3960 demand (support) below us. Looking at the technical if we were to have another bullish day tomorrow we could be attempting to establish todays low of 3990 as a new demand (support). That would much like SPYS daily S/D be very bullish. With the demands (supports) stacked like that from 3920 to potentially 3990 (this would also turn previous supply of 3990 into a new demand) that is very bullish. I would then look for a push back to 4055 and potentially even attempt to take out demand at 4096 if we got a big enough bounce. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vykt6q3dclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f51a5dc781a4e46a4c74477fe4f306d4f5407042

From a daily price action stand point on futures is much of the same with this classic morning doji star/ double bottom off 3990 support today. This on futures is also a retest and support holding for the 100ema. 

With this price action (again dependent on data…) we should see a push to the upside tomorrow. My ultimate futures target is 4020 which would give us a close back over the daily 8, 50 and 200ema and ultimately would make me expect a rally back to the 4053 supply and possibly even as high as 4095 on Friday depending on data. 

However, in the chance that data is negatively received my ultimate downside target is a support test of 3920. This should be a major support test and as long as that holds then ultimately we should expect a push back to the 4000s. However, a closure under 3920 would be extremely bearish and could very well start a further sell off. 

Futures Levels:

Supply: 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand: 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily Support- 3990 -> 3955  
 Daily Resistance- 4020 -> 4055 -> 4085

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cph6ti5eclma1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fc53da399a0b78e0eb4b8676ea6272ca7d0af5a

The VIX is actually in an interesting place. I also mentioned yesterday that I was surprise with the fact that a 50bps is now nearly 70%+ “priced in” that the VIX did not break through 19.7. That is very odd if you ask me… now granted markets have absolutely been focusing on the use of 0dte options instead of longer DTE… but if markets truly “believed” that we were going to get 50bps, and that cpi would be red hot we would be seeing a much longer and more importantly sustained spike on the VIX. However, today we are seeing yet again the VIX unwind. 

The VIX remains at that 19.7 resistance at in a bear flag breakdown pattern that should lead once again to another drop to that 18.3 support rea. 

**DXY**

Now im going to start this with a disclaimer… I generally have watched the DXY and 10yr yield since probably mid summer time. However, I have never once taken a trade solely based off it. I do enjoy watching in general dollar/ yield up = spy SHOULD be down… now many of you know that does not always happen. Yields/ DXY have been moving in tandem with SPY which is interesting. Some are even saying that yields have finally gone too far… however, long story short im going to start watching DXY more closely and see if we can see anything. Merely going to talk out loud and see if there is any bigger correlations we can catch. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z9q54dcfclma1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb30751cb9524d4f752eafda6681c768a8016626

From a price action stand point DXY is in an overall massive rising wedge that dates back to January/ February. As of now price remains over its daily 8ema and had officially closed over the 105.6 level which was the high back form December. 

Just for reference at this time period when DXY was at 105.6 area in beginning of December SPY was at trading in the 380s range (this was directly post December CPI). This means we are about 4.7% higher on SPY now than we were back then. 

Current trend would allow for DXY to fall as low as 104.7 by Monday (day before CPI) and rise as high as 106.4. 

**10YR YIELD**

I am starting with the same disclaimer here that I am merely watching the 10yr like this in order to see if we catch anything to help us. 

&#x200B;

The 10yr is in this same rising wedge pattern as DXY. Which I actually find interesting as SPY daily is in a breakout triangle pattern which I full expect it to hold within leading into CPI. This rising wedge on DXY/ 10yr COULD be the hint that we actually see a breakout to the upside on SPY which also supports my thesis on a bullishly received CPI. 

Currently the 10yr is sitting just under 4% after briefly breaching it today. For reference on the 10yr the last time it was this high was back in November. At which time SPY held that 395 to 405 range leading into CPI before it saw the bigger dump. In that sense we are actually spot on with where we should be here… 

From a TA stand point we actually have a pretty nice but ugly head and shoulders or W pattern formed here with our lows at that 3.4% area and highs here at the 4% area… that would indicate that the 10yr will sell off and that would lead to a pump on SPY… 

Overall from a macro stand point 10yr and DXY suggest we are in a place where they are likely to retrace which might be support by jobs data and CPI and that could lead to a rally on SPY.

I got pretty chopped up today and some how managed to put in a decently small red day and still have a pretty nice green week. I recognized early on today that morning range and chop. I took the first opportunity for a call when we broke out over 399 and closed there this morning and was immediately stopped out. With the massive wicks on the 15min chart I once again waited for the breakout and when we broke out around 1145 and closed a new HOD I once again was immediately stopped out. 

I still looking back have no good reason or data to support why from 12 until 130pm we went on that massive dump from HOD to LOD like that. It really was fully against the technical at the time.

Best play of the day was the 14dte calls I took near the 3971 support are on futures (a major weekly support). That rogue EOD pump printed calls nicely and turned what was going to be a pretty sour day into just an annoying day. 

Frustrating to feel like I was behind and buying the top/ bottom on every play. However, I will say that I followed my rules and almost every play I took everything I look for in an entry (especially the first 3 calls I stopped out of) were all 100% signaled.. as in I have everything I look for with a perfect call entry. I wont let one day change my strategy as its tried and true… after a successful day yesterday with the volatility today was a humbling reminder that FED days do not generally fit into my ideal trading strategy. 

At the end of the day though tomorrows a new day and there will always be a new day… we have to at time know when to walk away and know when the day just isn’t going to give us what we need.",DaddyDersch,77,0.87,87,0,0,87,10,2023-03-08T22:24:29Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ma6zv/day_two_of_jpow_chopped_up_all_eyes_on_jobless/

11lxh9t,DD,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #029: Oracle of Omaha Buys More Oil, Breaking Down Antara Capital's Activity With $AMC | Insider Trading Recap","GM,

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **February 27th - March 3rd.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **February 20th - February 24th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

Now lets take at the 50bps rate hike change… from a 32% chance at open to 69% chance as of 325pm today… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kaxbgpbgzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c26ad43456b5676aca178b69444bb1cba282df88

So what does this mean? 

I see two real scenarios that are about to happen in the markets… 

First scenario is that SPY is going to drop into CPI (next Tuesday the 14th) most likely targeting 390 support test -> CPI comes in good (better than expected) -> market absolutely rallies into FOMC. (most probable).

The second scenario is that markets realize they over reacted and we base/ hold 400+ into CPI -> CPI beats -> rally into FOMC. 

I am bullish on CPI and I think that it is going to show that a 50bps is not warranted yet. I believe what is happening is that the market is setting us up for a MASSIVE green CPI day. I am still waiting for official CPI consensus but as of now it looks really good for a beat (bullish). That CPI beat is going to dump the probability of a 50bps a lot and we are going to see a massive rally.   
 

FOMC when they confirm 25bps will be well received, however, the dot plot coming out is going to be nasty and markets much like December are going to dump heavily. 

&#x200B;

As you can see we still have a DOOZY of data the rest of the week… I expect some 1% +/- opens over the next few days depending on what data does… going to be a real volatile week as we head into CPI next week. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cdu2c9dhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14bea0571bb60447ed699d6322b94b4c183048cf

Today played out absolutely beautifully. We have that perfect evening doji star pattern that as I suspected would establish a new supply at 405.2. We not have a new supply put in short of the previous supplies (resistance) at 414-417. With this new resistance/ supply put in here we should look to take out lower supply at 396.46 before we push higher.

As I said before we do not want to leave a supply down below before we push higher. 

IF this sell off continues tomorrow if we reach that 394.7 to 396.5 range tomorrow we are going to come into some pretty hefty support. However, if we happen to lose 394.7 demand (support) tomorrow or really any day this week) then that would 100% set us up for a push lower back to 388.52 demand (support) that I was targeting before last weeks $12 rally. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mpbfs6uhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba559e8f9d737ba99d1743e4919ed9c10a1bd840

Taking a look at SPY daily here you can see we are still in this bigger blue breakout triangle here. With this new supply (resistance) being established today it perfectly correlates with our 405.3 channel resistance that has been a long standing pivot level on SPY. 

I frustratingly but conservatively did not take that 31dte put swing overnight. However, the risk of this going the other way today was there. 

Taking a look at the daily here the biggest thing to note is that we have no closed back below the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema. The last support remains at the 100ema which is hovering just over that 396.4 supply I mentioned before that was a target. The 100ema sits at 397 for tomorrow. 

Tomorrow we have data before market open and we have JOLTS at 10am (data) when JPOW once again will start testifying to congress. There is a lot of unknown. On one hand what possibly could jpow say tomorrow or be asked tomorrow that could actually reverse this or make it sell of further? Not much in my opinion. 

The biggest bear case is that the markets have not (with only one day) fully priced in a 50bps hike. So some more downside should be warranted. The other oddity is that for how reactive SPY was to that drop today the VIX was very underwhelming. Which shows people don’t fully believe it yet… 

I think as the data comes in this week with more big data Thursday and Friday we will have a very volatile EOW. I don’t think going long here is worth it for puts or calls. I do favor 390 before we retest 405 again, however, with so much data and JPOW anyone predicting this is just guessing.   
 

I still remain under the consensus that regardless of what happens before CPI… that CPI print (unless consensus comes in hot af compared to Bloomberg/ Cleveland fed) will be very bullish and when markets (algos) see that the CPI DID come down and that its IS lowering compared to last CPI/ CORE YoY that the chances of a 50bps hike are gonna dump for whatever they are at back to non-existent. 

While there is always a chance that JPOW drops a 50bps bomb on the market… in all reality the chances of it is very slim. While inflation is not going to go straight to 2% easily and it will rebound (meaning YoY will come in OVER previous YoY) but I do not think it is going to be this CPI print as of now. 

However, when the FOMC meetings DOT PLOT comes out on March 22nd that is going to be very spicy…

SPY Levels:

Supply- 405.17 -> 396.46 -> 383.82  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 398.2 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  
 Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5

Futures had a beautiful pattern today too with supply/ demand playing out perfectly. As I had mentioned we were looking for that 4055 new supply (resistance) to be established and we officially got that today. Not only that though we came down perfectly to take out previous 4015 and 3991 supplies from the last 2 weeks. 

With 3991 and 4015 out of the weigh this opens up a push lower to 3960 and 3920 demand. My ultimate target for downside remains 3920. However, if we get a bounce tomorrow and markets decide to rally into CPI then I would be looking for 4096.

Taking a look at the daily chart here on futures we are just chopping inside of this red channel that stretches from 3920 to 4095. 

With a breakdown last week to 3925 -> recovery to 4082 yesterday -> pattern would suggest a breakdown to minimally 3920. This would be a classic 123 rollercoaster as I have talked about so many times. 

Futures today unlike spy closed below its daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. However, it is currently sitting directly on the 100ema. We did bounce direction off the support from Friday at 3983 today too. There is always a scenario where we get a massive double bottom after a drop like this. 

If we were to backtest resistance my targets would be 4020 and 4055. 

Futures levels:

Supply- 4054 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3960 -> 3920  
 Daily support- 3990 -> 3983 -> 3955 -> 3945 -> 3920  
 Daily resistance- 4020 -> 4053

Overall despite today being a highly volatile fed day and that massive $4 dump instantly at 10am I had a pretty good day trading. 

I unfortunately found myself in one of my level to level calls. I did not know jpow had a pre-released statement or I would have exited my calls before 10am. I did not expect a -$4 candle but it is what it is. Got a terrible fill on my stop loss too.   
   
 

Outside of that was a pretty great day of trading. I did take some long puts (30dte) in the morning and set a 10% stop loss and was a victim of that rogue $2 green candle at 1215pm. I am pretty bitter about that as I went longer dte on purpose and I would have ended up with a nice 15-20% win. It is what it is but that is my only gripe from today.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

11keysk,DD,Pre-JPOW day… the dove or the hawk? 3-6-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis,"Well after two massive green days covering $10+ today started off hella strong only to find ourselves rejecting off a major 5, 15min, daily and weekly resistance at 407.3 intraday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8bncailu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ce4b8603bade09931f338f04f698c7e5e4bf5ac

For those of you that don’t know JPOW testifies to congress tomorrow and Wednesday. This is a yearly thing that he has done since at least 2021. 

In 2021 we saw a red day, however, in 2022 we saw a pretty big green day putting in nearly 2%... the question we have to ask is… “will markets listen to jpow and interrupt what he is saying as hawkish finally? Or is this going to be like the last 3-4 times he spoke where the markets had blinders on?”  
 

Based on the last 2 weeks of downtrend (outside of Thursday and Friday) I honestly think markets (and more importantly the algos) are more ready to accept a hawkish JPOW and are more ready to sell off depending on what he says. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/si3wu0ylu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ab668ddf7ff2144e42753f313ee8fa3f0f6ce79

Taking a look at supply and demand here on SPY daily if you remember I said one of the more short term bullish but longer term bearish scenarios was that SPY would come up and take out 405.74 demand from 2/10. We did just that today. Now what is important is what happens next. With this evening doji star pattern here and the techicals pointing to a new supply being established soon… IF spy closes below todays low there is a very good chance we are going to see this 405.74 demand turned into supply. Turning a demand into supply (resistance) is extremely bearish and would cement not only this level but would also cement a lower supply than the previous ones up in that 414-417 area. 

All eyes remain on tomorrows close to see what that technical show. If we establish this 405.2 as supply tomorrow then my ultimate target realistically is 396.5 supply from 2/24. If we can take that supply (currently support) out and turn it into a new demand or reconfirm previous demand (support) at 394.88 that would be very bullish going forward. I would 1000% play a bounce from that 395/396 area back to 405.

Looking at the daily chart here everything is screaming put here. This evening doji star pattern is one of the highest probability setups for a put. If it wasn’t for jpow speaking tomorrow and Wednesday and my overall lack of trust in this market and the fact that pre markets have seen some incredibly volatile overnight swings… I would 1000% be in at least a 14-30dte put. I fully expect the 400 support area (which is the daily 200ema) to be retested this week when we see a structure like this. 

SPY:

Supply- 396.46 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 404.4 -> 399.7 -> 397.8  
 Daily Resistance- 405.3 -> 407.2 -> 408.2

Now if you remember on futures last week we had taken out previous demand and now we are officially in a no mans land. We either need to find the extra strength to push to 4096 before we establish a new supply (resistance) short of that. OR we need to establish a new supply (resistance) and come take out lower supply at 4015/ 3991.

For me personally based on the technical and daily price action we should turn todays candle into a supply (resistance) here at 4055. Doing so will then open up a retrace to “take out” previous supplies at 4015 and 3990. IF we take those out and can establish a new demand before retesting 3960 then I would like a push back to 4096. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

taking a look at futures daily price action here are one could imagine the candles are similar to spy (which isn’t always the case) and we are actually seeing a pretty significant reversal candle set up here too. With the SPY and Futures daily reversal set ups I would be surprised to not see a retrace to minimally 4020 tomorrow. 4020 is currently where the daily 8, 50 and 200ema sit. However, there is a chance with JPOW speaking tomorrow that the algos could do something funky which obviously would result in a breaking of technical. 

Again if it wasn’t for JPOW I would have felt pretty darn comfortable in overnight 25-30dte puts. But little reason to take the risk. 

Futures: 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily support- 4050 -> 3983  
 Daily resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4113

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ohkn1jou6ma1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bce6682c02e23d6edb60b2f5bcc9af2ddddf2c47

Overall the VIX is still in a down trend here as you can see. However, it put in a really nice inside day today. Historically speaking inside days result in continuation but is not always the case. 

I mentioned on Friday that the 18.2 support touch on Friday should have resulted in a VIX bounce which is clearly did. However, that apparently did not account for the fact that SPY wouldn’t care that the VIX was green all day long too… nor would it account for the fact that yields once again were elevated again while SPY was green. 

The only thing that played correctly was that DXY was down just slightly today while SPY was green.

Absolutely a great way to start off the week! No complaints at all. I got burnt as you can see twice in calls though. The first one I stopped myself out of when we were playing around that 406.5 to 407.3 morning/ mid day chop… I entered a call on support (what I thought was) and price action broke a key level. I took my exit and then of course it pushed to HOD. Tough bounce but was the right play and the right stop loss. 

Only other loss today was a stop out when we  bounced off support and once again had a fake break down.

The morning was extremely frustrating to trade as we were seeing that VOLD was extremely bearish along with the VIX and the yields, however, SPY continued to push up. Made for some choppy trading. 

&#x200B;

However, the best play of the day was the 1225am retest of 407.3 resistance. I saw it as a short opportunity and took a beautiful 9.4% win. I ended up closing for profits when we came back down and were holding 405.3 support at 1pm. I actually was looking for a bigger recovery back up to 407 again. However, EOD actually ended up being fairly bearish. 

I am bearish to neutral. If bulls take back 405.3 tomorrow then I would be bullish until we touch 4096 supply. However, I feel fairly confident unless jpow pumps us tomorrow that we establish a new supply and will push back to that 3990/4015 area this week.

11k21rf,DD,$BOIL & $KOLD DD,"Ok $BOIL hardos, I tried to post this sht on Friday, but I didn't enough karma lmao. But here it is in the wake of the 40c Natty drop this session. I'm now hard for $KOLD.

After reading that post about ""Freeport never, ever going down again"" I decided to post some of my own research. Like sure, we're all a lil' regarded, but to say that a facility that literally went kaboom will never go down again is just not really DD. So here's what I found and are my thoughts on Natty-G.

First thing before I get into the actual fundamentals is that the AUM for BOIL is off the charts, which is causing issues for the dudes running it. There are position limits on the exchange, so they are having to go to banks to get swaps to keep up with the fund interest. What does that mean? For the longest time, BOIL just tracked NG 2x, but now with such massive interest, BOIL is actually influencing the underlying contracts higher. Every day they have to go out and buy 2x the lots to make sure they aren't left holding the bag when we eventually take our own out. And I mean like hell yeah, bullish $BOIL right? But what happens when the fund has to roll? This ain't what happened in 2021, like yes you can stop out shorts, but we're talking about an actual commodity that isn't just influenced by us, it responds to actual market prices, and those prices say lower. This ain't us vs. some fund, it's us vs. everyone in the US who uses natural gas, which btw is literally everyone.

And they have to sell out and buy the next month because the contracts are for a physical commodity that is bound by month, aka if they don't sell they have to take delivery of a lotttt of actual cow farts in Louisiana. When they sell that many lots in such a short time, it ain't gonna be good. If today's price of NG tanks, the price of summer gas has to tank too because if it didn't, everyone would just buy cheap gas now, put it in storage, and just sell it in the summer. So the summer contracts will drop too. It hasn't been a problem in past months because BOIL wasn't such a large part of the market, but now, dumping that many contracts right before they expire is going to influence the whole futures market past this month (which is the largest part of their position), and that influence ain't gonna be up. Yes, they will use those funds to buy the next month and push it up, but again, we don't have the power here like we did with that retailer; the physical market will eventually tank price this summer in the face of every $BOIL position as we've already started to see today.

[https:\/\/ycharts.com\/companies\/BOIL\/total\_assets\_under\_management](https://preview.redd.it/bfef2sqm05ma1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0508d0aced725b66994c01b7e9a9be0ce885ee81)

Ok on fundamentals, I believe that the BOIL run is basically done, had a nice little uptick Friday. But, many of y'all have been taking profit (see the far right of the chart above where total assets are dropping, so so much for hodling smh although after the rally on Friday y'all bought more, buy high sell low right?), and the final cold weather before next winter is about to hit. This means we're going to turn to injecting the gas into the ground and changing to summer pricing. What does that look like? Well, what do you do when supply is ""10"" and demand is ""8""? You store ""2"" in the ground to use in the winter when supply is still ""10"" and demand is now ""12"". But guess what, that storage space has to be there... We are at the upper range of our natural gas storage coming out of a very warm winter, meaning that before this coming summer ends, we are going to be totally full (we are producing at a record pace and the earnings releases I looked at didn't say they plan on slowing down this year). Again, I ain't the sharpest spoon in the drawer, but I know that when supply is ""10"", demand is ""8"", and you don't have anything to put your ""2"" in, price jumps off a cliff. I can repeat the example with bananas instead of numbers if that's helpful, it helped me anyways.

11izux2,DD,"SPY Technical Analysis for Monday March 06, 2023 - Market watchers eye 200 Moving Average backtest","# Slower Rise in Service Provider Costs Boosts Investor Spirits

US stocks ended the week on a positive note as speculation about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes dominated investor sentiment. The S&P 500 saw a rally on Friday, breaking a three-week losing streak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its best day since early February.

Despite a report showing the service sector's resilience, investors remained upbeat, betting that the impact of the Fed's hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers revealed that costs were rising at a slower rate, which helped buoy traders' spirits.

Although bond yields rose for the week, a Friday rally in treasuries caused the 10-year yield to hover around 3.96%. Meanwhile, the dollar index had its worst week since mid-January, following four weeks of gains.

Investors will be eagerly watching next week's non-farm payrolls report for clues on whether the economy can withstand further rate hikes. This week's data showed continued labor-market resilience in the United States, bolstering the case for the Fed to maintain its tightening policy, which pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.

However, traders were encouraged by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic's remarks on Thursday that the central bank may pause rate hikes this summer. Although Bostic and his colleagues stressed that their decisions would remain data dependent, traders interpreted his comments as dovish. A Fed report released on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are on the way, but it appears that investors are feeling optimistic regardless.

# Market Risk Alert

At 16:15 ET, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said that if inflation persists, the central bank may be able to raise interest rates further. This comment came after a statement earlier in the day where Barkin indicated that Fed policymakers anticipate more rate hikes and no rate cuts this year. The Fed has been closely monitoring inflation as it considers its policy options.

At 12:03 ET, a senior European Union official said that the US and EU are working toward an agreement in principle on a free trade agreement-like status. The two sides have been negotiating for some time, and this announcement is a sign of progress. A free trade agreement could have significant economic implications for both the US and the EU.

The Federal Reserve released a statement at 11:03 ET indicating that the labor force participation rate is likely to remain well below its level from before the pandemic. This could have important implications for the economy and policymakers, as a lower participation rate could indicate weaker labor market conditions.

At 09:48 ET, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said that reports about the United Arab Emirates considering leaving OPEC were ""far from the truth."" This came after several media outlets reported that the UAE was considering an exit from the oil-producing group. Meanwhile, the price of WTI crude oil strengthened amid ongoing concerns about global supply and demand dynamics.

# Market watchers eye 200 Moving Average backtest: How will prices react at 404.05-405.86

Investors are keeping a close eye on the 200-day moving average as a backtest approaches. The key focus is on how the price reacts around the 200 moving average or resistance zone, which is currently set at 404.05 - 405.86. This will help determine whether there are more sellers or buyers based on volume. In addition, there is the possibility of overshooting the 2022 downturned diagonal resistance at 407.50 - 410.01.

If the market experiences downside, bulls will be on the lookout for potential support at 399.66 - 397.82 while using 401.93 as a pivot. However, if the potential support is lost, bulls' last hope would be at 395.49.

## Expected Move Based on Patterns

*As noted, we are nearing the half measure to the upside.*

#### What is a rectangle pattern?

A rectangle is a technical pattern that occurs in trading when the price of an asset moves between horizontal support and resistance levels. This pattern suggests that there is no clear trend in the market as the price oscillates between these two levels. The rectangle pattern typically ends when there is a breakout, and the price moves beyond the support or resistance level.

Traders have different approaches to trading rectangles. Some traders prefer to trade within the rectangle, buying when the price is near the bottom of the range and selling or shorting when it reaches the top. Other traders prefer to wait for breakouts before taking action. They believe that trading breakouts can result in larger profits because the price tends to move significantly in the direction of the breakout. Ultimately, the approach a trader takes will depend on their individual trading strategy and risk tolerance.

11icg21,DD,"VIX Gang, Stand Back and Stand...BUY!","TLDR; YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY\*

&#x200B;

Bears, if you would like a nice little rub and tug, look no further. This post will explain why buying shares of leveraged volatility products cannot and will not go tits up.

I am down 37 bands since I last posted[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj63p9/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvxy_svxy/) 8 months ago. I haven't given up my thesis or my dollar cost averaging and I won’t until capitulation occurs, be it next year or next week. As I see it, the longer this equities bubble persists, the more time I have to build up my already quite large position. In this post I would like to discuss my perspective on: **Why the VIX is asleep, Hypothetical price targets for UVXY, and How my strategy has changed.**

Disclaimer: The 2x volatility index that I trade is below the $500mm market cap (or AUM in this case) allowed by WSB, so I will be focusing on UVXY for this post. Check my positions at the end of this post to see exactly what I am doing.

Another Disclaimer: I’m quite regarded. While my DD should be solid from a factual standpoint, only imitate my positions if you don’t mind the possibility of having a few extra inches added to the circumference of your anus.

Without Further ado.

**Why the VIX is Asleep**

As many of you may know, the VIX index is calculated using a very complex equation, but essentially is tracking the spread of options premiums on the SPX. In uncertain times or market downturns, as traders scramble for downside protection, these spreads can get sporadic and the VIX will spike.

So what gives? Why hasn’t there been a meaningful increase in the VIX index since the market has fallen \~20% last year? I mean, the VIX spiked over 150% with the Fed rate hikes in 2018 while the market dropped \~18% from September to December. Well the answer has to do with a worrying trend that has started getting out of hand in the past three quarters: institutional investors and hedge funds trading 0DTE options on the SPX. These types of trades create ample liquidity in the options market, rocketing the indices to new highs (remember when QQQ closed +7.35% on 11-10-22 ?) and suppressing the VIX index. This can lead to a vicious cycle with lower lows in the VIX begetting higher highs in the SPX, encouraging further 0DTE  gambling. But every cycle must come to an end…

[0DTE SPX volume at an all time high, while the VIX and VVIX make sharpest declines since Volmageddon](https://preview.redd.it/eassycii7sla1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51dcdea114d3bee283968cec8b9b89bdb9bd0d44)

These types of trades generate large profits for the institutions who are able to sell far OTM options without posting collateral. However, as we all know, trading 0DTE comes with its risks. When the narrative regarding the economy changes (consumer debt is at all time highs, while household savings is nearing all time lows btw), or a large player in the 0DTE market leaves for whatever reason (drying up liquidity) hell will break loose. When the price stability in the options market goes haywire, VIX will spike. On top of this, scrambling for 0TE puts to hedge will drill the SPX as MMs need to sell SPX short to gamma hedge.

To conclude this section, trading 0DTE works very well… until it doesn’t. Now onto the fun part: price targets.

**Price Targets**

First things first, this volatility spike will not be like Dec 2018. How can I be so sure? Well, because if it was, we would have seen it happen already. In early October 2018, the market reacted swiftly to Fed policy, with the VIX following closely behind.

[VIX reacts to market declines immediately in 2018](https://preview.redd.it/o0xiim3u7sla1.png?width=3785&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b8960cae702ae056eb2b6da4769f1d31868beb3)

Compare this to what we see now. A sell off, comparable in percent decline, without the fireworks on the VIX:

[VIX stays calm despite 20&#37; drawdown](https://preview.redd.it/qlli2yfy7sla1.png?width=3767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c25bdbd233a47be331dc7ef74efbe9856b338be9)

Okay, so VIX is dead, so what? Well I’d like to convince you that this is a premonition of something far more violent than the VIX spike in late 2018. I believe that this first 20% leg down was orderly selling by institutions, all of which are preparing for a monstrous capitulation in the coming year. I’d like to remind you that despite the fact that we are off of the all time highs of Jan 2022, we are still in a massive equities bubble that is only exacerbated by earnings contraction and the weakening consumer. Given that we are at the end of a 12 year secular bull run, I think it’s appropriate that we look at the behavior of the VIX in prior recessions.

**2001**

March 2000 to June 2001-- SPY: -22.7%, VIX: +40%

June 2001 to September 2002-- SPY: -38.1%, VIX: +113%

[VIX trades sideways until second leg sell-off](https://preview.redd.it/ybyjqrm28sla1.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b205a5ed556446aa4d552df5013d6e0e29678e1)

**2008**

October 2007 to August 2008-- SPY: -16.7%, VIX: +3.3%

August 2008 to October 2008-- SPY: -24.8%, VIX: +419%

[VIX snoozes until MASSIVE spike during OCT '08 capitulation](https://preview.redd.it/nk2rnqq68sla1.png?width=3790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=61d7edc7470c202d168b0ff18d02d0ab1efefc56)

It is apparent that when a big recession is brewing, the VIX will remain relatively tame during the first leg down, before exploding during the final capitulation. So what are my price targets for the coming capitulation?

**Price Targets**

I am going to use the historical prices of UVXY during the COVID crash to extrapolate what we may be able to expect from a leveraged volatility ETF during a full blown panic. I am aware that the COVID crash was a rather unique scenario, with the first pandemic in a century adding extra fear and volatility to the sell off on the way down. I am not here to argue about the exact price that VIX will reach, but given the recent 0DTE gambling, declining housing market, impending wars, persistent inflation, etc. I think it is reasonably realistic to use COVID crash as a model example (especially considering how much larger the bubble has gotten since 2020).

UVXY hit an intraday low of 105.5 on February 19, 2020. After a wild month of trading, UVXY topped out at 1350 on March 18, 2020. This astounding 1180% price increase is a testament to how extreme leveraged volatility ETFs can behave in uncertain times. But wait, UVXY is only a 1.5x leveraged VIX futures product. What if we wanted more leverage? Hypothetically, the 2x leveraged ETF that I own (that I shall not name) would return a staggering 1606%. This is like going from 16.18 (it’s closing price on Friday 3/3) to 276.06. Remember, this is just based on the COVID crash. Whether or not this next spike will come up short or surpass this return, no one can know. What I do know, is that your returns will likely be so significant that you cannot lose money buying shares of these products.

**WHY YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY**

[A painful chart to look at](https://preview.redd.it/8ixiplob8sla1.png?width=2294&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd8b848a17f2dfba201cd2d69cfb4f409213996a)

UVXY decays, we know. We also know that the return needed to break even on a losing trade becomes more and more daunting as your percent loss increases. For the sake of this DD or (perhaps more accurately) hardcore bear porn, please indulge with me. Imagine that on Monday a crash similar to COVID crash begins, it won’t, but just imagine. What does this mean? It means that over the next month, UVXY will go from 4.57 to 58.48, an 1180% return. Wow! If you bought on Friday at close, that's a great return! But let’s be real, that would never happen. We all know that timing the market is extraordinarily difficult. This is the number one reason I quit options. Suppose you still wanted to capture some of the return from that incredible spike in UVXY. Well, what if you dollar cost averaged? I can already hear the replies, “DCA in UVXY?!?!?! What a regard” and on and on. Well I think this strategy may have more merit than you give it credit for. Why? Two reasons: dollar cost averaging allows you to build up a massive position in UVXY (or another volatility product) while not having to time the crash. Sounds like a win-win.

Now, consider the chart I posted above. Consider that in order to break even on this hypothetical UVXY spike you would have had to buy UVXY and then sustain a 92% loss.

12.80x = 1

x= 0.078

1-x = 0.92 = 92%

Do you understand what this means?? It means that to lose money on this trade you would have to own shares of UVXY at an average share price of 58.49 or greater. A price not seen since May 2021! Jeez even I’m not \*that\* early on the trade. What’s more, is that you would have had to buy at that price and not have accumulated any more shares. If you so much as bought any shares after that date, you would be in the green due to a lower cost basis.

Now yes, this math works for the COVID crash scenario. Okay, well lets say UVXY only spikes a measly 800%. To break even you would need to buy at an 89% loss. That’s like buying UVXY at 41.13… again, in May 2021.

Reference the chart above for other scenarios, but I think you get the picture. Keep this in mind as you consider the percent drawdown in my positions (aka unrealized loss porn) below. Know that my cost basis decreases weekly.

**TO CONCLUDE**

The 4 phase plan is the same as it’s been with a minor change. I will:

1. DCA into a volatility product until capitulation
2. Put earnings into SVXY or similar index and ride the volatility back down
3. **Put money into QQQ** (instead of SPY) with as much margin as I can get
4. Wait for the real estate market to bottom and buy a house

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

UVE is an residential homeowner insurance company.   


We'll have a quick look at the chart then go into the financials of the company.

Key Take-Aways  
Price is at the $19.25 resistance- and has been flirting with it through out the week.  
Earnings hit: -22M Net Income, They did better than expected, but still down .41  
Dividends are paid out $.16 on 8 March. This is considered a high yield for the company.  
RSI shows it's been a hot buy.   


**Financials**

Financials are based on annual reporting.

Turns out they’re the go to for on-ramping crypto buys for corporations and large buyers trying to operate legally. For example when Tesla bought those billions in Bitcoin, they didn’t buy it from a miner they went through an intermediary bank. 

Here we get to the meat and potatoes. They’re in the news because evidently they had exposure to FTX (crypto exchange) and obviously the bear market has hammered them. They’ve processed $1 trillion since 2017 and were the trusted go to for on ramping, buttt major players are now coming out saying hey don’t worry we don’t have Silvergate exposure.

In general, a good margin of safety is one that provides a cushion against potential losses due to unforeseen events or market downturns. This means buying an asset at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. As a rule of thumb, a margin of safety of **30% or more** is often considered a good starting point for value investors. However, the appropriate margin of safety will depend on various factors.

He emphasizes patience and discipline when making investment decisions, where one should maintain a long-term investment horizon and avoiding the temptation to chase short-term gains.

Some high level things to look for when trying to pick a company:

1. Strong financials: Companies that have a history of generating consistent cash flows and profits, and that have a solid balance sheet with manageable levels of debt.
2. Competitive advantage: Companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage, whether it be through a strong brand, a unique product or service offering, or a dominant market position.
3. Good management: The quality of a company's management team is critical to its success, so companies should have experienced and competent leaders who are aligned with shareholders.
4. Valuation: Buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value, so companies that are trading at a price that is lower than we believe the company is truly worth.
5. Growth potential: Finally, companies that have strong growth potential, whether it be through expanding into new markets, launching new products or services, or through organic growth.

Let's explore each item from someone who's looking at SNDL as a potential addition to their portfolio:

\- Strong financials (Weak):

* SNDL doesn't have a consistent cash flow and profit history, where it is only recently that the company had achieved a positive Adjusted EBITDA (mainly due to it's newly acquired liquor business).
* It's preferable to pick companies with a net profit margin of at least 10%. SNDL's net profit margin is currently **-54.54%**.
* It is preferable to pick companies with manageable levels of debt and that its debt-to-equity ratio is below 1. SNDL's debt-to-equity ratio is **0.18**.
* A current ratio of at least 1.5 indicates that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term obligations. SNDL's current ratio is **6.60**.
* It is preferable to pick companies with a strong return on equity (ROE) of at least 15%. SNDL's ROE is **-18.89%.**

\- Competitive advantage (Medium): It comes from a highly competitive Canadian cannabis market, where its collection of different brands and incorporation of the liquor business provide it with a decent product mix. Also a strong balance sheet makes it easier for the company to do quick moves when the time is right. That being said, would this be considered sustainable? How long till that money turns into a bad investment decision? Compared to its competitors it has a very unique mix of assets.

\- Good management (Medium): Zachary George has done a good job at consolidating and concentrating company efforts. He has a good understanding of the company's challenges and has a very good wholistic understanding of the cannabis ecosystem, it's safe to say that he doesn't have tunnel vision when it comes to his planning of the operations. That being said, positive financial operational performance has been mainly driven from non-cannabis related operations.

\- Valuation (Strong): You can preform your own valuation when it comes to SNDL, but for the purposes of this demonstrational analysis, I'm going to be looking at the Analyst Price Targets posted on Yahoo finance.

The range of values is from a $2.98 low to a $5.96 high and an average of $4.12, for a conservative margin of safety approach we would want to look at the lower end estimate as our starting point. We would then apply the 30% margin of safety which would result in a $2.086 price point. Currently SNDL is trading at around $1.8 which means that it is around the purchasing range which would incorporate the margin of safety.

\- Growth potential (Strong): We all understand that the company's cash position is good. Sitting at around CAD$649,031,000 there is no idea what the management team will do with it. But from the looks of things, it seems that they are maybe simply looking to dominate the Canadian market.

Overall, while each of the factors I mentioned is important, strong financials are a critical component of any good investment opportunity, and should not be overlooked. Companies with sustainable business models, strong balance sheets, and consistent profitability are the ones that tend to create long-term value for shareholders.

11gj983,DD,Temporary bottom or dead cat bounce?... 3-2-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis,"I had some questions yesterday about my supply/ demand levels on SPY and why they may have seemed “off.” So let me explain a little. 

The gauge/ indicator identifies new levels either supply or demand. and unless it ""takes it out"" then its still there. Thats where this price action on SPY is VERY weird because like you said we should NOT establish a supply and then be over it and be under a demand like that either. however, with the current price action and these wild 1% +/- gap ups/ downs thats where the technicals are showing something that just isn’t quite playing out yet… it just is an testament to how odd this price action has been and how irrational it truly has been. (below information is from last night not todays charts/ price action). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uq0mqvvcqela1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce14a8e43717623fd24278596669c5fbf001cfe

The issue is that its not flipping the name of supply/ demand but the issue is because SPY is only intraday trading but really its tracking with ES we are getting these massive gap ups that is messing price action up... look at futures and you can see its not like that at all... we ARE breaking through previous 3975 demand but just established a new one at 3960 which makes sense. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxsr3cedqela1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09c69e16d3b302d796351150fcf416db30674766

However, looking at SPY here this is the issue... so we formed super nice resistance at that 414+ area and then we started our descent and the way the price action has happened we put in demand at 405.74. From there we had a really nice bounce which took out a demand at 409.6... this opens downside back to the demand. So the issue comes in that we had that huge 2% drop last Tuesday which then resulted in a goofy massive wick day on Thursday that established a demand.

The next issue is that we did not push up to take out the 405.7 demand we just continued to dump.

Same thing this week we had a huge absolutely weird movement on Friday cause of data which put in oddly a supply (granted not a strong one but its there and enough to note)... and now we are pushing back down...

So what REALLY needs to happen to ""balance"" this out is for SPY to establish demand down here somewhere form 388 to 396. push all the way back to 405.74 demand. and then either retrace to confirm a new demand. or establish that as a new supply and then we can start our fall back down.

So what im saying and honestly its funny (I posted all this last night in the TA comments but just recapping it) is that we are seeing this play out now… in this scenario we will push back to 400.7/ 3990 area and then we will be more balanced and looking better technical wise. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yz7cyfwdqela1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=791aff7701ae8577afb074663e153f3770c57056

If you were wondering what the change today and the massive pump came from was Bostic… So just like that a 50bps scare flash crashes the market and then a 25bps discussion spikes the market… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cnbypvbeqela1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09132536b4850e1401bd19d41e3f828af676cfe1

Oddly enough the current estimate is still at 30% for a 50bps and has not come down. Im not sure if this CME is live or not so this probably overnight will see an adjustment. 

Where does that leave us then? Are we bullish? Bearish? Or is this a temporary bottom? Relief bounce? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hlwlqdqeqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0a052258e8cdc06497437b528a2152cbd5e7a2f

Lets take a look at our current supply and demand daily levels. Today was a big day for sure. 

On SPY we have established with this push up today 394.7 as a new demand level. With that demand on SPY itself we have an upside demand of 400.7 and 405.7. Now SPY is as I mentioned yesterday in extreme bear momentum so most bounces should reject off the daily 8ema. However, if we can close a green day tomorrow we very well could break that extreme bear momentum as we had just entered it on the 27th and are not very deep into it yet. 

If we can continue momentum tomorrow my target would be 400.7 demand level which is going to corelate perfectly with a daily 20ema resistance test. 

On SPY supply wise we have that 396.5 area and besides that the next major supply level is up near 414-417. 

Supply and demand for SPY wise the most bullish case here which is support by indicator is that we will go up tomorrow potentially as high as 400.7 (but honestly we don’t need to go that high), establish a NEW supply somewhere over 396.5. Then early next week a healthy retrace to take out that 396.5 supply and potentially confirm demand at 394.6 would absolutely open upside to 405 area. This is the scenario I most closely am watching for. 

On a bearish supply and demand case for SPY If we were to fail to breakout to 400.7 which is probable since we did not have any meaningful pullback today and we establish a new supply up here this could have been a dead cat bounce. IF that happens and we reject this daily 8ema retest here especially if we double top then I would be eyeing us to come down and retest previous demand at 388.5 early next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/39df6aafqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cbf0631618efd9816c6de81fb88c60926d3b3b8

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we broke through that red falling wedge/ bear channel which does give us upside to the black resistance which will be around 401.9 tomorrow and also coordinates with a daily 20ema resistance retest. 

Bulls were able to retake the daily 100ema today however, they are going to face heavy resistance as we come into that 400 to 400.6 level as that is the daily 50/200ema and that is previous demand and we should have the daily 20ema lingering right above there. 

With this daily bullish engulfing candle here I remain short term bullish. I really was hoping for this to hold closing to 397 and see a bigger pullback to take out some 15 minute chart supplies down at 396 first. With the daily 8ema being here and extreme momentum we are likely to see a rejection here or at least minimally retest support down below. I was planning to long here with a 30dte call however we did not pullback and I do believe that will come tomorrow. 

There is potential if bulls can close on a bullish note tomorrow… which would be a close over 396.4 that this is a bullish and I would suspect a run up next week into CPI. 

Supply- 396.5 -> 414.13 

Demand- 394.64 -> 400.7 -> 405.7

Key SPY Support- 394.6 -> 392.7 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 397.9 -> 400 -> 400.7 -> 401.6

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i5444msfqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1cb2f11c2abc67c4d64f4b91c9ac6a86e74b47ed

Taking a look here at the futures daily supply/ demand chart you can see that we nearly last night came down within 5 pts of the 3920 demand from 1/19. While we did not touch it that is still very bullish in nature to have that long of a wick. Now this is where TOS and TV differ but on TOS this is a double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle with is bullish. 

With a new demand now established at 3960 we have officially taken out previous 3975 demand. You can see though as I mentioned on Spy with us being in extreme bear momentum that the most probable place for a rejection is the daily 8ema which is where we rejected and not only that but we rejected off that 3990 supply. 

If bulls can continue momentum there is a case to be made where we could close over 4020 tomorrow, establish a new supply and then end up coming back down next week to take out 4015 and 3990 supply. This would be very bullish. If bulls lose 3960 on a retest though that would signify that we are gong to come back down to that 3920 demand eventually. 

On the daily I do see on both SPY and futures a IV drop (bullish) and I do see reversal conditions set up volatility wise. This could all set us up for this to actually be the temporary bottom. 

My thoughts are with the fed members talking about 25bps now and talking about how CPI was a fake rebound (or temporary) that this actually is setting us up for a rally back to 405 next week prior to CPI. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6kb5ypbgqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d49ec280a76bc0bbd74c72eee39b3b74741dba60

Taking a look here at futures you can see the same thing that we are coming in closely here on the daily 100ema and 8ema. Both of which did hold as resistance today. IF this continues tomorrow upward the 4020 level is going to be a major resistance level as that is going to be the daily 20, 50 and 200 ema along with being a previous supply level. 

From a bullish standpoint a closure over 3975 tomorrow would be extremely bullish for the weekly timeframe. 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015

Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3985 -> 3990 -> 4016 -> 4020

**TESLA TA will no longer be included.** I have found I am being pulled in too many places.. my own fault… I will no longer be focusing on Tesla in my daily TA. It is something I will chat about occasionally but it just isn’t something I plan to trade anymore. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the VIX here this was a pretty impressive drop on the VIX. We actually have broken back under 19.6 for the first time since February 16th. Which was the first day of the current down trend that we are in. This 19.6 is a pretty major pivot level here and this could also with this massively bearish engulfing candle signify a local bottom. 

I do think the evidence of a bottom is there and I do think that if we close over 3975 tomorrow that there is a high probability that we see a push to the upside next week. 

Next week is pre-CPI week which historically does move a good amount. The case of a rally into CPI now instead of a dump into CPI is growing here. We have two more fed speakers tomorrow and we will have to see what they have to say compared to what the fed speakers said today.

Overall day trading today and really this week has been pretty excellent. I am very satisfied with my trading and how the week has gone. Strictly from a day trading perspective one of my better weeks in a while. 

Today I finally cut my AMD and Nvidia swings for a loss from last week. I really should have waited on Nvidia earnings before I opened AMD/ nvidia last week but honestly based off other tech I had very little to suggest they would beat let alone rally 12% like they did. I also though that would be a blow off top and would drop us even lower after. 

Unfortunately I considered pretty much all day cutting AMD which was around -25 to -28% all day and Nvidia around -60 to -65% all day. I finally decided by EOD I would cut them and then that investor decided to announce a huge stake in AMD and I watched the price pump $1.2 before my eyes and premiums drop a top. I bailed then and im glad I did as that took a huge pump right after. 

Looking at my long puts I was able to close them all besides AMD and Nvidia for profits. I had plenty of opportunities (especially on AMD…) to close them for much less but I kept holding thinking it would finally retrace. 

Would I take the play again? Yes but I would have waited till after earnings this time. Not a big deal gonna close my week red but that’s alright. I still like the trade in the end of the day.",DaddyDersch,83,0.87,75,0,0,75,10,2023-03-02T23:06:33Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11gj983/temporary_bottom_or_dead_cat_bounce_3223_spy_es/

11ge76y,DD,THE CASE FOR GOING LONG CRUDE OIL (UNITED STATE OIL FUND),"&#x200B;

[Current Position: I'll roll this 2 times per week and shoot to make an extra $800 per month with $27,000 and once on Fridays I'll roll it to the next weeks expire same strike or less.](https://preview.redd.it/fbssna1j5ela1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d3dca4065703363f69eacad043ae704e6fb7c28)

I started selling cash covered puts on USO today. I have been a huge fan of doing so on QQQJ for years but it is time for some oil. Below is my DD. I did my best to clean it up, I hope it's valuable.

June 1, 2008 the United States Oil Fund was at $909.28 per share. On April 27, 2020 the United States Oil Fund was at its lowest ever price of $18.86. In todays case study we explore the Federal Reserve and price action from 2006 until March 2023, present.

## When to Trade Oil Successfully, Three Patterns

* One pattern that is evident is that the price of WTI **Crude oil** & USO tends to be **higher** towards the **end of the year** and **lower** towards the **beginning of the year**.   
*\*\*The price of crude oil is consistently lower in January and February, and higher in October, November, and December.* 
* Another pattern is that the **price** of WTI **Crude oil** & USO tends to be **more volatile during the first quarter of the year**.   
*\*\*For example, NYSEArca: USO, the range between the high and low prices is much larger for the months of January, February, and March compared to the other months.*
* Average percentage change is 5.34% to 5.91% between monthly time periods based on USO open and close data from 2020 to 2023  
*\*\*For example you know prices will swing month to month about these % changes.*  


## The Current State of Crude Oil & It’s Effectors

* The state of the global economy can drive up or down demand for oil, as can geopolitical events such as conflicts in major oil-producing regions. 
* Changes in technology and energy policy, such as the rise of renewable energy sources, can also affect demand for oil. 
* The effects of US macro news on commodity prices, including oil, are stronger during periods of high market volatility, and the effects of monetary policy are more pronounced for energy commodities. 
* The price of oil tends to be more volatile during the first quarter of the year, higher towards the end of the year, and is generally increasing over time, with some fluctuations. 

### More Patterns Based on USO Stock Price Data Since 2016

There has been a recent decline in energy prices, which is expected to continue throughout the year, potentially providing some relief for households.

1. The overall trend of the USO stock price seems to be increasing over time, with some fluctuations along the way. This suggests that the company has been performing well and growing in value I’d say and shows demand growing.
2. The trading volume tends to be higher in months where there is a significant change in the USO stock price. For example, the highest trading volume in the dataset occurred in March 2022 when the stock price had a large increase.
3. There are some months where the opening and closing prices are very similar, indicating that there wasn't much volatility during that period. For example, in January 2022, the opening and closing prices were within a few cents of each other.
4. There are also some months where the range between the high and low prices is quite large, indicating that there was significant volatility during that period. For example, in October 2022, the high price was almost $14 higher than the low price.

### The Summarized Case for Global Growth, War, 10-Year & Historically Low Oil Prices

As of March 2, 2023, the current state of the global economy is having a significant impact on the relationship between oil and other economic indicators, particularly the 10-year period. Historically, in periods of economic growth, there is an increase in demand for oil and oil prices, while a downturn in the economy results in a decrease in both demand and prices. Presently, the 10-year period is at an all-time high, indicating a positive outlook for the global economy. This is attributed to the world's successful comeback from the COVID-19 pandemic that brought many economies to a standstill.

The price of WTI Crude oil and USO tends to be more volatile during the first quarter of the year, higher towards the end of the year, and is generally increasing over time, with some fluctuations. Recent data shows that there has been a decline in energy prices, which is expected to continue throughout the year, potentially providing some relief for households.

Macroeconomic news releases and monetary policies, particularly those from the United States, have a significant impact on commodity prices. Positive news typically results in an increase in prices, while negative news leads to a decrease. Currently, the news has been neutral, and no significant changes in commodity prices have been observed.

Geopolitical events such as conflicts in oil-producing regions can have a significant impact on oil supply and cause prices to spike. The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, coupled with a high demand for oil in China and India, has the potential to drive oil prices up. Therefore, it is essential to keep an eye on geopolitical events as they remain a key factor that could disrupt oil supply and drive prices up in the future.

Based on the patterns observed, the price of crude oil is consistently lower in January and February and higher in October, November, and December. In addition, the price tends to be more volatile during the first quarter of the year, with a higher trading volume in months where there is a significant change in the USO stock price.

Overall, while the global economy's positive outlook and neutral news have had a stabilizing effect on commodity prices, geopolitical events remain a key factor that could disrupt oil supply and drive prices up in the future. Therefore, it is crucial to weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions in oil stocks.

## A Trading Strategy Tweetsift Follows

We will focus on selling bi-weekly cash covered puts on USO for an extra $200 per week in income with $28,000 in our account. If assigned we will actively sell cash covered calls. According to the research starting in October we will see the price of oil go higher like it does every year. 

With the volatility of the beginning of the year is over with and the middle of the year here, demand coming back. job growth doing well, housing market still doing OK and a new global increase in manufacturing demand, we here at Tweetsift think this is a great time to enter into WTI Brent Crude futures and USO.",the-tweetsift-report,24,0.8,24,0,0,24,1,2023-03-02T21:12:37Z,False,False,t2_5w30rny94,10000,10000,2051,10000,2023-02-24T23:47:54Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ge76y/the_case_for_going_long_crude_oil_united_state/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%.

11fkqnv,DD,Sell the RIP… 3-1-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis and Recap,"Well after yet another day of high volatility, high IV and range bound movement ($3.31 total movement intraday) we are yet again still seeing sell the rip happen here in the market. Will this continue or will we see an upside push? 

One interesting thing to note now is that SPY and Futures are both officially in extreme bear momentum. Which means that we are going to need a bigger and more aggressive bounce in order to see a reversal upside. We would need to close over the daily 20ema and continue upward after that to convinced me of an upside reversal. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rxy43puh7la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4168786563e1a067dbad4a60bc58a5c929a16fa

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we have that nice 396.36 supply level that we established on Friday. With that being established we then broke out over it… tested demand and rejected it at 400.6 and then came back down and now we are closing back under supply. This is very bearish in nature. 

I would suspect with this movement especially with the rejection and closure back under the daily 100ema today that we should continue to see a push down until we either establish a new demand or we bounce off 388.66 demand. We interestingly enough still have a very old supply level at 383.81 that has not been taken out yet. We could see a large push or large flash crash there eventually (think CPI or FOMC) to take that out before we go back up. 

Again I remain bearish overall until SPY closes over 400.6 and now until we close and HOLD over 396.36. 

The biggest bullish case here is that we establish a new demand in this 390 to 394 area over the next 2 days and that could set us up for a bigger push back to that 400.6 demand which would get us a daily 8, 20 and 200ema retest. From there though I still would suspect downside unless we are able to hold up there. WE also today turned Fridays 395.4 support level into resistance today which again just further confirms downside. 

I would actually like to be in some 14dte puts on SPY but the issue is that premiums are getting theta ate and chopped up with this high IV and these massive moves up before it finally retraces. 

Supply- 396.36 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.6 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 394.7 -> 393.6 -> 391.5 -> 390.1

Key Spy Resistance- 395.5 -> 396.3 -> 397.3 -> 397.8 -> 398.5

I again remain far more bearish on futures than I do on SPY itself. What we have here yet again is a daily 8 and 100ema rejection on Futes. One thing to note here too is that we had established a demand at 3975… broke over it… established a new supply the very next day… and then now we have rejected that supply level and lost/ closed under that demand. Which again as you can imagine is bearish in nature. 

The next bigger demand here to keep an eye on is 3915. Similarly with Spy until we realistically can close and hold a candle over 4020 supply I am not bullish on SPY and with futures also in extreme bear momentum we should look for upside pushes to sell the rip. We of course can play and does appear to be happening everyday the LOD bounces to retest resistance before falling lower. However, the risk to reward is low for such plays. 

Despite almost every day being a tight $3-$4 choppy annoying range… at some point we are going to get a bigger breakout move and I will not risk being on either side of that. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020

Demand- 3975 -> 3915

Key Futures Support- 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920 

Key Futures Resistance- 3968 -> 3975 -> 3990

Tesla is sitting in no mans land. I actually almost took some calls on it because of investor day tonight (its going on right now and let me tell you it’s a snooze fest)…. Speculation remains that a new model will be released here that is about 25k-30k… lets see if that happens. 

From a technical stand point we are stuck between 194.25/ 196.3 demand and 207.7/214.23 supply. Essentially there is no play until we either establish a new supply below the current 207.7 one which would indicate the ceiling is get lower and we could look for a retest of 194-196 and possibly lower, or we get a new demand above 196.3 which would confirm that $2 range as massive support and that would push us back to that 207-214 range. Until that happens there is zero play. 

Interestingly enough looking at the last tesla investors day it had an 6%+ drop the following day… 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75  
 Demand- 196.29 -> 194.25

Key Tesla Support- 202.8 -> 201 -> 197.8 -> 196.3 -> 194.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 206.3 -> 207.7 -> 210.8 -> 214.2

Interestingly enough the VIX did not break down today but it did close a red day while SPY also closed a red day which is definitely not the normal way this market works. The VIX held the 20ema support here but did reject the daily 8ema. 

One interesting thing to note is that the last time the VIX was in this area was February 17th… SPY had a LOD of 404.05 and a HOD of 407.51 that day. Currently with the VIX at the same level our LOD was 393.38 and HOD was 396.69.

What is the main point… despite “fear” not spiking we are seeing a market retracement.

I just realized I made a ton of trades today. I made 10 intraday trades (also closed 4 different longs) today vs. 6-7 trades/ day that I have been averaging. 

I had opened a slew of 30dte puts on Friday and pretty much Monday immediately regretted it. I thankfully was able to exit all but AMD and Nvidia today for profits but my bags were pretty heavy most of this week. The most frustrating thing was how these stocks would move up and down the way they did. 

Actually the most frustrating and kinda fascinating thing is that despite most of the stocks I was holding have decent drops over night/ intraday they did not gain as much value as I anticipated that they would. My SPY puts were the most frustrating. They closed ITM at about 6% red… and with the morning opening and a 0.3%+ drop I had only gone from -6% to -3%... I have no idea what was going on with that. I ended up holding until the 2nd drop and then felt like I was winning just being able to exit. 

MSFT was the same was too… closed down about 10-12% and with a -1% drop I had barely seen breakeven. Didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. 

Something else that is funky this whole week is that the intraweek contracts so 3/2 and 3/3 spy options IV is extremely elevated. It goes from 3/3 puts having a 20% IV to the 5dte 3/6 puts having an IV of 15%. I noticed it earlier in the week and we still haven’t seen IV come down. Its like the week is pricing in a huge movement but its not happening. 

Overall though a good day of trading despite all the chop we had. Really only the bad part of the day was getting burnt in a call around 145pm that appeared to have a nice bounce coming up. Only to break a key demand so I exited early. I jumped into a put for the downside move and ended up getting stopped out on that big 2pm doji candle and then the next candle proceeded to dump. 

Outside of that this has been a pretty good week of trading.",DaddyDersch,52,0.88,67,0,0,67,5,2023-03-01T22:46:00Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11fkqnv/sell_the_rip_3123_spy_es_futures_and_tesla_daily/

11f4z2k,DD,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #028: $DASH CEO, CFO Dump Company Stock, Largest Trades Overall + By Market Sector From The Past Week","GM. Welcome to March.

**TL;DR** \- Insider purchases jumped this week (+116%), notably due to a series of buys made by Mubadala Investment Co Pjsc into Recursion Pharmaceuticals ($RXRX / Biotechnology). Otherwise, there was a general drop in activity, with 753 insider transactions (-26%) filed by 643 corporate insiders (down from 859 the prior week).

Below are some notable sales from insiders:

* Andy Fang, a Director at Doordash ($DASH / Internet & Direct Marketing Retail), **sold his entire position** in a $7.8M sale on Feb 21st
* Tony Xu, the CEO of Doordash, **sold his entire position** in a $7.8M sale on Feb 21st
* Keith Jensen, the CFO & Chief Accounting Officer of Fortinet ($FTNT / Software), decreased his stake by 95.56% in a $5.9M sale on Feb 23rd
* Scott Donnelly, the Chairman, President & CEO of Textron Inc ($TXT / Aerospace & Defense) decreased his position by 24.55% with a $16.3M sale on Feb 21st
* David Powers, the President & CEO of Deckers Outdoor Corp ($DECK / Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods) sold 28.05% of his stake for $14.4M on Feb 21st

And some notable buys from insiders:

* R A Walker, a Director at ConocoPhillips ($COP / Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels), increased their position by 21.05% with a $494K purchase on Feb 22nd

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $29.8M to $64.5M (+116%)
* Sales decreased from $1.9B to $1.3B (-31%)
* Transactions decreased from 1,014 to 753 (-26%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 452 to 354 (-22%)
   * Net buyers increased from 28 to 37 (+32%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 424 to 317 (-25%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 859 to 643 (-25%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 48 to 45 (-6%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 811 to 598 (-26%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **February 20th - February 24th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **February 13th - February 17th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?

#### Summarized Key Points

* Federal Reserve Bank directors reported steady economic activity in their Districts but with uneven sectors: **neutral**
* Some directors expect inflation rate, which remains elevated, to slowly moderate in 2023: **bullish**
* Directors of two Federal Reserve Banks favored maintaining primary credit rate at 4.5%: **neutral**
* FOMC raised target range for federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% to 4.75% effective February 2, 2023: **bearish**
* Board approved raising interest rate paid on reserve balances from 4.4% to 4.65% also effective February 2, 2023: **bearish**
* Calculation of federal funds rate every two weeks as the average of daily effective rate and rate on 3-month CDs over previous 14 days rounded to nearest 5 basis points: **neutral**
* Secretary authorized to inform Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Reserve Banks on establishment of primary credit rate at 4.75%: **neutral**

So we have 2 bearish points 1 bullish point 4 neutral points. Showing us the **FOMC is sounding more neutral and bearish** in todays release of the Minutes of the Board's discount rate meetings from January 23 and February 1, 2023

#### Quick Summary

Federal Reserve Bank directors reported steady economic activity with unevenness across sectors, and some expected inflation to slowly moderate in 2023. Two directors favored maintaining the primary credit rate at 4.5%. The FOMC decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5-4.75%, and the interest rate paid on reserve balances was raised from 4.4% to 4.65%, both effective February 2, 2023. The Secretary was authorized to inform the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Reserve Banks about the establishment of a primary credit rate of 4.75%.

#### Explained for Everyone

The Federal Reserve is an organization that helps control money in the United States. They recently made some changes to interest rates that could affect how much people can borrow and how much they have to pay back.

Some people at the Federal Reserve said that the economy is doing okay, but some parts are not doing as well as others. They also said that prices might not go up as fast in the future.

The Federal Reserve raised the ""federal funds rate"" by a little bit. This is like a price tag for money that banks borrow from each other. They also made it so that banks get a little bit more money for keeping their money in the Federal Reserve.

The Federal Reserve also told some other banks that they could charge a certain amount of money if other banks borrow money from them. This amount of money is called the ""primary credit rate"". The Federal Reserve said that these banks can charge 4.75% interest if someone wants to borrow money from them.

Overall, these changes could affect how much money people can borrow and how much they have to pay back. It might also affect how much things cost in the future.

We have seen credit deteriorating in the auto loan space according to a federal governor who spoke at Harvard yesterday which can be read [here](https://tweetsift.substack.com/p/ai-summarizes-a-speech-by-governor).

#### Use this information to make informed decisions about your trading strategy. 

Based on the summarized key points, it appears that the **FOMC** is **sounding** more **neutral and bearish**. Traders should keep an eye on economic indicators such as inflation and credit deterioration in the auto loan space, as these could impact the Federal Reserve's decisions about interest rates. Remember, they want a SLOW down.

The FED's recent decision to raise interest rates and make it more expensive for banks to borrow money from each other could impact borrowing and lending, which could affect the stock market and other markets. Traders should keep an eye on these changes and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.

Traders should monitor economic indicators and be prepared to adjust their strategies based on the Federal Reserve's decisions and actions.

11ekw5w,DD,Choppy Chop Chop… 2-28-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"Well what was looking to be a pretty boring and untradeable day got to be a little exciting there EOD. I actually was very surprised to see bulls push it up like they did middle of the day as most technical did not really support a move like that. However, as seen below a perfectly timed tweet seems to have coordinated perfectly with that massive $3.13 sell off. It is not common that we go coast to coast (HOD to LOD) but we sure did today…

Actually the most impressive thing is the fact that the final one minute candle dropped a total of $1.2. 

To me it seemed like markets were starting to forget about the whole 50bps hike thing and CPI being HOT… However, they were kindly reminded today and that seems to have fueled this sell off here today. 

With markets reminded of 50bps we could see a small continuation sell off tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at SPY here you can see we have a really nice black bear channel going here. There is also a tighter more aggressive bear channel (red) inside of that. That could very well be a falling wedge. If that is a falling wedge then resistance for bulls to break for an upside push would be 397.4 tomorrow. That level coincidentally enough was MAJOR support almost all day long. 

The biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50/200ema for the first time in over a month. Not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn’t even touch it. Despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that. 

I still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until SPY closes back over 400. We also have an established supply level at 396.42 that we did break back and close under today. This level could turn itself into nice resistance here. We have a large gap on supply back down to 383.81 and upside to 414/415.23. After establishing demand at 400.6 on 2/23 we retested that yesterday and rejected there. We should with that rejection seek on next demand at 388.66 unless we can establish a new demand this week first. 

Supply- 396.42 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.62 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 396.3 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.44

Key SPY Resistance- 397.3 -> 398.5 -> 400 -> 400.6

Taking a look at ES futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than Spy. I said I was worried that we COULD see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind. However, bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection, crossing the daily 8ema below the 50/200ema and closing under the daily 100ema. Now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here. 

Demand was established at 3975 on Friday which could have provided a bigger push up. However, we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here. With a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand. 

However, Supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988. With a rejection off supply and also losing demand here I am very much so bearish on futures and I am looking for that 3915/3920 area to be touched. I remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020 

Demand- 3975 -> 3915 

Key Futures Support- 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3975 -> 3990 -> 4000 -> 4008 -> 4020

Tesla had a surprisingly weak showing today. I would have expected more strength today leading into investor day. However, after establishing a supply zone at 207.7 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 214.24 and was unable to. With that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 196.3. However, with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way. 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75

Demand- 196.29 -> 164.18

Key Tesla Support- 205.6 -> 202.1 -> 197.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 210.7 -> 214.2 -> 219.2

Kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema… but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there. That could come tomorrow though. One thing I did note that besides Friday the PC ratio is very low this week on Spy.

11ek6i5,DD,S&P 500 analysis.,"BEFORE YOU READ

Now i know what your going to say “this regard is using crayons to predict the market!” However, I want to clarify that the patterns I will be comparing with the S&P 500 are not drawn but rather based on past price action. While some may argue that the past cannot be compared to the present , these four patterns have consistently demonstrated similar behaviors. I have yet to find any patterns that contradict them, although there may be additional patterns that I have not yet discovered. This analysis is based on data from the year 2000 to present, and these examples serve to illustrate my point.

The chart is in the weekly candles and all of the patterns are from the S&P 500.

First off, we have a cyan pattern that occurred between February 2010 and September 2010. It suggests a potential 5% downturn from the current price, which is expected to occur in mid-May.

This pattern is perhaps the most accurate, since the pattern closely mirrors the actual price action

https://preview.redd.it/uh7vweuowzka1.png?width=1647&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c85a891542775caf017cc2d5e77d994587c97f2a

The second pattern in purple is from March 2002 to March 2003, and it suggests a potential 6% downturn from the current price, which is also expected to occur in mid-May.

https://preview.redd.it/qgrkpspqwzka1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33d5507ec74bf7233e38d6c011cde2fbb3292917

The third pattern in red is from October 2007 to September 2008, and it suggests a potential 14% downturn from the current price, which is also expected to occur in mid-May.

I am aware that this pattern is during the housing market crash, but the current price behavior indicates parallels with the crash of 2008.

https://preview.redd.it/w15qe95swzka1.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=948397c5e60e5bf786b96f1f826d23518c1ed1c1

The fourth pattern in yellow is from August 2000 to December 2002, and it suggests a potential 16% downturn from the current price, which is also expected to occur in mid-May.

Again I don't believe it will experience such a significant drop, but it does exhibit similar patterns to the crash of 2002.

https://preview.redd.it/umetnokuwzka1.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=033d180934dfa5d623b0a6fbfd632570606635fc

I have discovered that there are several patterns similar to this in the S&P 500, but I am unsure if there is any pattern that does not suggest a decline in mid-May. Despite my search, I have not been able to find any such pattern, and every potential pattern I came across indicated a decline until mid-May. Therefore, I am uncertain of the extent of the potential decline, but if my analysis is correct, it seems likely that the decline will halt in mid-May. But if I had to say I think that the cyan pattern is very likely to happen.

So check this out! As the supply of magnesium metal **alloys** in the US is running thinner, keep an eye on Western Magnesium Corporation MLYF to see if it continues its uptrend as they get closer to their AGM on March 10! **They will be the only magnesium manufacturer left in America after the government is working to shut down Utah based US Magnesium for being toxic and using to much water out of the Great Salt Lake!**  Western Magnesium uses a new clean, non-toxic, low-energy process from US dolomite for producing top grade magnesium metal for many industries, including auto, steel, aluminum, and the DOD!  Magnesium metal is extremely light: it is 75% lighter than steel, 50% lighter than titanium, and 33% lighter than aluminum. It has the highest known damping capacity of any structural metal, capable of withstanding 10x more than aluminum, titanium, or steel!  Many large automotive companies have already replaced steel and aluminum with magnesium in various parts of their products to lighten the load. They already own land in Nevada, where they are working to move their operations already in test production and plan to ship to ports on the west coast. Magnesium **alloys** are a much needed strong, light weight metal in today's industries. Just think of how much further cars, trains, & planes could go by reducing their weight from heavy metals! The US needs a clean supply of magnesium and magnesium alloys from here at home and not rely on other dirty processes in countries like China.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%.

11dne3l,DD,The road to 390… 2-27-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"We are officially in the massive pre market move followed by intraday range/ chop trend… probably one of the most frustrating times to be a day trader as unless you swing (and are correct) we are left with the crumbs… Look at the massive pre markets we have had over the last 7 trading days… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xenw9whttska1.png?width=348&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=270107a1bb0a95bf269537e2c7d714c5a3e5022e

Average open over the last 7 trading days is +/- 0.83%. That’s pretty dang impressive.. 

Today was probably one of my favor intraday SPY patterns… the classic 123 rollercoaster.. I have talked about this numerous times but essentially a 123 rollercoaster is 1) the initial move in this case the dump from 401.29 to 398.26… 2) the recovery in this case that is the pump from 398.26 to 399.51 and then finally 3) the final bigger push past initial low… in this case that’s the EOD push to 397.2 area. Its actually really refreshing to see this pattern play out today as this is how SPY used to behave and generally behaves in a healthy market… these massive V bottoms and Massive LOD to HOD reversals are NOT the normal even though 2022 wants us to believe they are. This is healthy and refreshing to see especially on a bear trend day… 

&#x200B;

So the question is where does this leave us? 

&#x200B;

Despite the pretty impressive 0.9% green open and the push over 401 this morning the bears were able to capitalize once again. This honestly reminds me of the last 2 months but in reverse… how many times did we see major morning dumps and red pre markets only for the bulls by EOD to take it green or at least recover most of the loss? We are seeing the same thing here… and honestly today is a VERY bearish candle closure… 

Taking a look at the daily here we had a previous demand level at 400.6 that we came up and attempted to close over today and hard rejected. Generally speaking when we have a demand level like that and we get a massive rejection it is very bearish for the future. Not only that but we kissed the daily 8ema resistance today and hard rejected it with the wick and we hard rejected the daily 200/50ema with the candle body. 

The most bullish thing that we can take away from today is that we bounced off the daily 100ema support once again. However, with the demand level rejection, and daily 8/50/200ema rejection I am going to be looking for a bigger sell off here on SPY this week. My target remains 390.1, however, we do have a previous demand level at 388.66 that we could bounce off. IF we get here and can bounce I will absolutely be looking for a play back to 405.8 demand. 

Current demand levels= 388.66 and 405.81. 

Key SPY Support- 397.7 -> 396.4 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 400 -> 401.7 -> 403.2

The futures candle with this hanging man candle with a beautiful daily 8, 50 and 200ema rejection screams downside to me. However, there IS a double bottom here off 3975. Bears need to break through that level tomorrow and more importantly close under that level. 

I am targeting 3920 support bounce on futures. If we are able to get there then I will 100% be looking for a bounce back to the 4000s. 

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 4000 -> 4020 -> 4032 -> 4055

So Tesla investor day is on Wednesday apparently at 4pm… I thought about it over the weekend and thought some lotto calls for investor day to let ride would be a great play and well that turns out to be absolutely correct. However that ship has far sailed… a day too late for sure… 

Taking a look at tesla here we had that really nice hammer candle doji that also re-established 196.3 as demand on Friday. That led to a pretty massive bounce and yet another gap to the upside. We also have no held the daily 8ema as support and have closed over the 202.1 resistance it fought at all week. 

Our next demand level is 211.5 and that is where I will be keeping an eye on for this week and tomorrow. There is a very real buy the rumor sell the news potential with Tesla this week. 

Demand levels- 196.3 and 211.5

Key Tesla Support- 205.1 -> 202.1 -> 197.8 -> 196.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 207.9 -> 211.6 -> 214.2

The VIX was pretty much all over the place today. Despite the VIX pretty much dropping from opening this morning it did have a bounce off the daily 8ema which at the same time provided a downside opportunity for SPY. The one interesting take here is that SPY did NOT recover despite the VIX continuing its sell off. Watching the VIX continue to unwind while SPY falls is something very important to take note of.

Started the week off really nicely today. I am pretty happy with the day overall and I am even okay with the two losses I took. The first loss was on a potential breakout that ended up with a massive 50cent plus blip down that of course no one could have expected. The second loss I ended up cutting my put early when we broke through a key resistance. It would have ended up coming back to be extremely profitable, however, while I didn’t watch it the whole time I believe my -10% stop would have hit first. 

I did move up to a -10% stop this week officially and went live with that. So far so good obviously. It is definitely nicer knowing 2 nice wins breaks me even instead of 3 nice wins. However, will continue to evaluate as time goes on. So far so good and positive results there.",DaddyDersch,42,0.9,66,0,1,66,7,2023-02-27T21:26:26Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11dne3l/the_road_to_390_22723_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/

These stock stats provide some key financial ratios for the company over the past few months. Here are some observations:

**• Forward P/E:** The price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is also trending downwards, which suggests a more positive outlook for future earnings.

**• PEG Ratio:** The PEG ratio is high, indicating that the stock is relatively expensive compared to its expected earnings growth over the next five years.

**• Price/Sales:** The price-to-sales ratio has been relatively stable over the past few months, indicating that the market has been valuing the company's revenue consistently.

**• Price/Book:** The price-to-book ratio has fluctuated over the past few months, but has generally been in the range of 6-8, which suggests that the market values the company's equity at a moderate premium to its book value.

**• Enterprise Value/Revenue:** The enterprise value-to-revenue ratio has been trending downwards, which suggests that the market is valuing the company's revenue at a lower multiple than before.

**• Enterprise Value/EBITDA:** The enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio has fluctuated widely, indicating that the market values the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) at different multiples at different times.

Overall, the trends in the stock stats suggest that the market is uncertain about the company's future prospects and is valuing its various financial metrics at different multiples at different times

*50-Day Moving Average*  **161.15** 

*200-Day Moving Average*  **160.73**

From the stock price history provided, there are a few observations that can be made, but it's difficult to draw a clear conclusion or consensus without additional context or analysis. Here are a few points to consider:

• The beta of 1.04 indicates that the stock is slightly more volatile than the overall market.

• The 52-week change of -16.42% suggests that the stock has declined in value over the past year.

• The S&P500 52-week change of -9.23% indicates that the broader market has also experienced a decline over the past year, although to a lesser extent than the stock in question.

• The 52-week high and low prices of 254.87 and 137.16, respectively, suggest that the stock has experienced a significant range of price fluctuations over the past year.

• The 50-day moving average of 161.15 and the 200-day moving average of 160.73 suggest that the stock has been relatively stable in the short term, but has experienced some volatility over the longer term.

Based on these observations, it's possible to speculate that the stock has faced some challenges or headwinds over the past year, given its decline in value and the wider market trend. However, it's difficult to draw any firm conclusion or consensus without further analysis of the company's financial performance, industry trends, and other relevant factors that could influence the stock price. It's also worth noting that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and that investing always carries risk.

*At the current trading price of* ***$166.96***, it is clear that the stock has recovered somewhat from its 52-week low of $137.16, although it is still below its 52-week high of $254.87. The current price may also impact the interpretation of the moving averages, which suggest that the stock has been relatively stable in the short and long term. Given the recent recovery in price, *it's possible to speculate that the market may be more optimistic about the stock's future prospects.*

# Balance Sheet:

**•Total Assets:** The Company’s total assets as of the latest period is $53.81 billion.

**•Total Liabilities:** The total liabilities and minority interest as of the latest period is $40.98 billion.

**•Net Debt:** The net debt as of the latest period is $12.79 billion.

**•Share Issued:** The number of shares issued as of the latest period is 471,274.

Overall, the balance sheet shows that the company has significant assets and liabilities, and its common stock equity has decreased over the past three years. T**he negative working capital is a concern and may suggest that the company is facing some liquidity issues.** The total debt and net debt levels suggest that **the company may be carrying a significant debt load, which could impact its ability to invest in future growth.**

*If we consider the current situation of rising interest rates and high inflation, it would change the interpretation of the financial figures. As interest rates increase, it becomes more expensive for companies to service their debts. Therefore, carrying a significant debt load can have a negative impact on the company's financial position, especially in times of rising interest rates.*

Additionally, **high inflation rates can negatively impact a company's earnings, as it can lead to higher costs of goods sold and other expenses. This could reduce the company's profit margins and ultimately, its overall profitability.**

Furthermore, **negative working capital can also be a concern in times of high inflation and rising interest rates, as the company may face difficulty in paying off its short-term liabilities. This could ultimately result in a liquidity crisis and financial distress.**

Overall, in the current situation of high inflation and rising interest rates, it is important for companies to carefully manage their debt levels, and ensure they have adequate liquidity to weather any short-term financial challenges.

**Analyzing the cash flow statement** in conjunction with ***the income statement and balance sheet,*** and taking into account current market dynamics, the following observations can be made:

•The operating cash flow has declined significantly from $10.5 billion in 2020 to $3.6 billion TTM, indicating that the company is generating less cash from its core operations. This decline in cash flow may be due to a decrease in revenue or an increase in operating expenses.

•The free cash flow, which is the cash available after capital expenditures, has been inconsistent over the past three years, with a significant decline in 2021. This inconsistency may be due to changes in capital expenditures or other investments made by the company.

•The company has negative working capital, which could be a cause for concern. Negative working capital means that the company has more short-term liabilities than current assets, which can result in liquidity issues if the company is unable to pay off its short-term obligations.

•The company has been investing heavily in capital expenditures, with $5.4 billion in 2021 TTM. While investment in capital expenditures can drive growth, it can also result in a reduction of cash available for other purposes, such as paying off debt or returning cash to shareholders.

•The company has been repurchasing its capital stock, which can reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase earnings per share. However, this can also result in a decrease in cash available for other purposes, such as investing in growth opportunities.

•The company has been issuing debt and repaying debt, which can impact its financial position, especially in times of rising interest rates. The company's total debt increased in 2021 TTM, and its debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, indicating a significant amount of leverage.

Overall, **the company's cash flow statement highlights some areas of concern, particularly the decline in operating cash flow and negative working capital, which could lead to liquidity issues** if not managed effectively. Additionally, the company's heavy investment in capital expenditures and repurchasing of capital stock could impact its financial position, and its high level of debt could pose a risk in a rising interest rate environment.

# Analyst Opinions: 

Based on the analyst estimates for the next 4 quarters, there is a consensus that earnings will increase over the next year, but at a slower rate than in the previous year. The average EPS estimate for the current year is $5.54, which is lower than the previous year's EPS of $13.56. However, the average EPS estimate for next year is $9.29, which indicates a significant increase in earnings. The revenue estimates also suggest modest growth for the next 2 years, with a 2.3% increase in 2023 and a 2.5% increase in 2024.

The earnings history and trend suggest that there has been some variability in actual earnings compared to estimates, with a few quarters having surprises both positively and negatively. The current EPS estimate has remained relatively stable over the last 90 days, but there have been some revisions to both the current and next year's estimates in the last 30 days.

Overall, these estimates suggest that there is a moderate expectation for growth in the company's earnings and revenue over the next two years, but there is some uncertainty and variability in actual earnings compared to estimates.

***If the market is worried about inflation and a potential recession, it could have an impact on the company's financial performance and stock price. Inflation could lead to higher costs for the company, which could impact its profitability and margins.*** A potential recession could also impact consumer spending and demand for the company's products or services. This could result in lower revenue and earnings for the company, which could negatively impact its stock price.

Therefore, if the market is worried about these macroeconomic factors, it could lead to a more cautious outlook for the company and its stock.

# Summary (TLDR): 

Based on the information provided, TGT stock for Target Corporation appears to have a stable financial performance in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and management effectiveness. However, **there are concerns about the company's ability to manage its debt, particularly in a high-inflation environment with rising interest rates.** The cash flow analysis indicates that the company has been generating positive operating cash flow but has also been carrying out significant capital expenditures and repurchasing capital stock.

Looking at the analyst estimates, there seems to be a general expectation of moderate growth in earnings and revenue for the next few quarters and years. However, the estimates have shown some downward revisions, possibly due to concerns about inflation and a potential recession.

Overall, TGT stock seems to be a stable investment choice, but investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with high debt levels and the current economic climate. As with any investment, it's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions.

11csa4m,DD,"SPY Technical Analysis for Monday February 27, 2023 - SPY caught in a tight squeeze between 200 and 50-day moving averages","# Swaps Predict Rate Hikes and Peak Rate by July - February 24 Recap

Wall Street's response to the higher-than-anticipated inflation data showed that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening campaign has a long road ahead, diminishing the likelihood of a gentle landing.

Volatility has risen after a prolonged period of calm stock movements. Beyond economic uncertainties, this is due to an expensive market resulting from a buoyant rally since October. These gains are decreasing day by day, as concerns of an impending recession have clouded the outlook for American companies.

The S&P 500 declined even further on Friday, deepening its worst weekly downturn in 2023. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 plummeted almost 2% as the two-year treasury yield hit its highest since 2007 at 4.8%, while the dollar rose. Swaps are currently pricing in 25 basis point hikes at the Fed's next three meetings, and wagers on the peak rate have climbed to approximately 5.4% by July. The benchmark lies between 4.5% and 4.75%.

The unexpected surge in the personal consumption expenditures gauge revealed the dangers of continuously high inflation. Moreover, resilient spending combined with the exceptional strength of the labor market may make it more challenging for the Fed to meet its 2% inflation objective. In contrast, separate data showed that consumer sentiment climbed to its highest level in a year, while new home sales exceeded forecasts.

# Pending home sales report for January expected to show a 2.5% increase

On Monday, February 27th, several major U.S. economic reports and Fed speakers will take center stage.

The day kicks off with the release of January's durable goods orders report, which is expected to show a 5.6% increase. Additionally, the core orders report for the same period will also be released. Median forecasts for this report predict a -0.1% change, indicating a possible decline in demand for long-lasting goods.

Later in the morning, the pending home sales report for January will be released, which is expected to show a 2.5% increase.

Finally, Fed Governor Jefferson is scheduled to speak at 10:30 am, providing valuable insights into the Fed's current outlook and potential policy shifts

# SPY trading between 200 and 50-day moving averages

The SPY is currently trading between its 200 and 50-day moving averages on a daily basis. We noticed some buying activity near the 393 level that we discussed last week. As we approach the prior resistance diagonal backtest and the uptrend support line, there could be a potential pivot zone around 393, 390, and 387. I'm anticipating a possible struggle and increased choppiness in the market this week.

https://preview.redd.it/xdnc4ei6ilka1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d975830cfad5f927a54e2c34ecc4fa11e7f664e

Assuming we do experience a rebound at this level, I'll be keeping an eye on the sell side discount in the vicinity of the 404-406 area.

This is my opinion, what we're seeing here is an obvious correction to the top-rate function causing YOY multi-linear growth in the S&P 500. COVID-19 has had a clear correlational effect on the stock market, it's undeniable. However, due to the cumulative effect of many down-rate joint stock indexing players–think World Bank Group, S&P Global, and other obvious parties–we see this clear dip. Due to this effect we should expect a clear uptick in my balls going directly into your mouth.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%.

11b1wlt,DD,ECPG - Encore Capital,"Hi guys. My first time posting some DD so please be gentle and maybe take me to dinner before you bend me over and tell me where I’m wrong.

The news today that inflation still isn’t under control an the fed is looking hawkish plus consumer debt exploding make a fairly obnoxious cocktail. My hypothesis is that the winner soon may be debt collectors and those who offer similar services. As the consumer debt market gets flooded with more credit card debt etc. the debt collectors will be able to bid at lower price and margins will be wider than your wife’s snatch.

ECPG collects debt in the US and Europe though its subsidiaries, Midland Credit Management and Cabot Credit Management respectively.

The stocks can currently be slide across the table for $53.53. The P/E ratio is 10.23 which makes it seem under valued with a market cap of $1.25b especially when considering the assets on the balance sheet total $4.51b Vs a manageable $3.33b in liabilities.

The bear case is that the p&l looks choppy with $194m in profit for 2022 compared to a £351m profit in 2021. This is on top of net £73m loss in Q4 2022. Earnings report is in May so we’ll know a lot me then.

It’s a move that essentially shorts the market and I’m feel pretty bearish at the moment.",Dank-but-true,14,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,2023-02-24T20:58:54Z,False,False,t2_57dyrd2dc,10000,10000,230,8546,2023-02-14T23:29:00Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11b1wlt/ecpg_encore_capital/

11au1fe,DD,Big Money Trying to Suppress $BABA Despite Turnaround and Solid Earnings Beat,"Wanted to share my thoughts on why Alibaba stock (BABA) is currently undervalued and trending in the opposite direction despite strong earnings release a few days ago. First of all, let's look at the numbers. Alibaba reported a earnings per share beating estimates by 35 cents per share. This is a solid 14% beat and it's no wonder that the stock had strong after hours gains. However, since then, the price has turned back red and is actually down since the release. It's almost as if the market is ignoring the strong earnings release. It's counterintuitive. This stock is already depressed on a valuation basis, 70% over the past year alone - one would imagine a positive beat like this would bring naturally reflect well on a Chinese Blue Chip like BABA.

From a fundamental perspective, not only have they laid off more employees than any American Tech company has in the past year (20,000), but its poor trailing performance is mostly due to one-off payments to the CCP for its ""intransigent"" behavior. With that mostly looking like a thing of the past, I would imagine margins will recover significantly in the coming months.

**My theory is that big money is trying to put downward pressure on the stock until the end of the week to try to avoid losing on calls that reflected the positive earnings.** Here's where things get interesting though. Last night, the price of  Alibaba's Hong Kong stock (9988) closed at 90 HKD, but this morning,  BABA was trading at 90$ pre-open (and currently as well). If you don't already know, the two stocks aren't 1:1 equivalent on the two markets. One share of BABA is equivalent to 1.04 x 9988. That's a lot of arbitrage. Unless this stock is a pure downward trend since this oddly positive earnings release, it would look like someone is trying to see this go in the direction they were hoping it would organically (due to a maybe negative earnings release).

As always, do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. But I've got a few calls here to see whether my theory is right in the coming weeks once the big money clears out it's shorter term calls. Inflation data did seem bad, but that came out today - I can't imagine that is actually what is happening here.

EDIT: So everyone just thinks these numbers are cooked essentially, right? That's what I'm understanding...

11a9amh,DD,"The bulls and bears continue to fight… 2-23-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well that was probably one of the most impressive V bottom recoveries we have seen on SPY in many months. A straight drill of $6 followed by a $5 rally. Absolutely an impressive but frustrating day to trade. 

That morning sell off has absolutely no chill at all… we straight dumped without even the thought or whisper of a pullback. That was one of the most aggressive downtrends we have seen in a while. What is even crazier is that we managed to recover it all…

&#x200B;

Tomorrow morning we get a doozy of data… consumer spending/ persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get PCE and Core PCE… with the preliminary PCE numbers along with PPI/ CPI we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in. I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers. 

The markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all… however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump. 

&#x200B;

The biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out. 

Bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength. 

However we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first? 

My thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish. 

IF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater. 

Key SPY Support- 400.6 -> 398.5 -> 396.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401.5 -> 403.2 -> 405.3

Taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018. 

The biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion. 

The biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though. 

Key Futures support- 4010 -> 3998 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures resistance- 4030 -> 4055 -> 4085

Tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now… As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn’t expect a bigger sell off… yet… The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming. 

Tesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown. 

Key Tesla Support- 202.1 -> 197.3 -> 191.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 209.2 -> 214.3

The VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn’t give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable.

Not too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn’t work out. 

Only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe… to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn’t be expected… Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same. 

I was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google. 

Overall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405.",DaddyDersch,102,0.83,66,0,0,66,6,2023-02-23T21:28:29Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11a9amh/the_bulls_and_bears_continue_to_fight_22323_spy/

119ywnp,DD,$WBD - Harry Potter is going to make $billions this year...and you can too!,"# [Hogwarts Legacy](https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us) is the latest blockbuster videogame released by WBD and is breaking numerous videogame sales records within the first few weeks of release.

[You nerds are going to make WBD execs a lot of money](https://preview.redd.it/zp8ylxk25yja1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbe307506dcba50fb295860bc919e10871b1b16a)

# Overview

Hogwarts Legacy's physical sales have already outpaced Elden Ring by 80% while digital sales are outpacing by 56% as of this morning ([source 1](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-stats-successful-launch/), [source 2](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-sales-numbers-so-far-figures-record/)). Assuming a blended 65% increase over Elden Ring's sales at an assumed $65/unit sold (many special editions have been purchased), **the game has generated a rough estimate of approximately $1.3B in the first two weeks of release**.

There are no known major issues with the game (some bugs present on Steam but no more than typical) and once it is clear the game is a hit among fans and the development is solid, the sales momentum should continue. Additionally, this momentum will likely see some benefit from the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch at later dates:

https://preview.redd.it/iwyr7teg4yja1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aaa3c979994d5deb48d5a4101cf770b54f7da824

Overall, Hogwarts Legacy will probably generate at least $2B in revenue for WBD within the first year of its release. The massive success of this game will open the door for more opportunities to expand on the Harry Potter franchise potentially including DLC for the game and possibly, a [new movie](https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-cursed-child-movie-release-date-cast-story-will-it-happen/).

# FY23 Estimates

[source: https:\/\/app.tikr.com\/ \(you need to sign up but it's free\)](https://preview.redd.it/mqza0wsp5yja1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1262b607d7c9d355b5d9089f63d799d902af061)

**WBD is currently trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV** with a forward FCF Yield of 5.7%. Estimated sales for WBD is $44.2B for 2023 (2% growth YoY, median of analyst estimates from Bloomberg, sourced from [https://app.tikr.com/](https://app.tikr.com/)) which surely includes Hogwarts Legacy sales but this estimate is probably a bit conservative based on very strong sales figures so far.

If WBD guides for an extra $500MM to $1B in sales for the year based on initial sales, this would imply a 3-4% increase in total sales (vs 2% estimate) which for a stagnant company like WBD, is a fairly big deal. Profit margins for new big name VGs can approach 50% or higher so with at least $2B in sales, at least a $1B increase in FCF seems realistic and would bring WBD's FCF Yield up to a favorable 7%.

# TL;DR - Focus on FY23 guidance, not past results!

* Hogwarts Legacy will generate at least $2B in sales in its first year
* WBD will likely increase revenue and earnings guidance for the year based on Hogwarts Legacy's strong sales so far
* Mgmt will want to further leverage the Harry Potter franchise given the massive success of the videogame with potential for DLC, another movie, or even a tv series (a la Disney)
* Markets are not yet pricing in the sizable revenue and FCF increase Hogwarts Legacy will contribute with WBD trading at a discounted 0.75x P/BV

My Position:

119on3f,DD,AI DEEZ NUTS,"**Preamble.**

Note: this is a play concerning C3.AI (ticker: AI). Recent NVDA earnings report is used as supporting evidence. I am not suggesting any NVDA positions, only AI positions. 

**Prelude.**

So it’s no secret that all the NVDA bears got ass blasted by their better-than-feared earnings report. Even I must concede that it was a pretty good report, especially given that their gaming revenues came in at $1.83b compared to analyst expectations of $1.59b, even in this ass gaming market. They even raised guidance \~5% due to further anticipated recovery in the gaming market.

HOWEVER, data center actually missed revenue estimates, coming in at $3.62b vs $3.85b. For the unaware smooth brains, data centers are where the GPUs that process AI training workloads are stored and maintained. This should not have been too surprising as most big tech companies that reported already told you they were cutting back on cloud/data center spend.

**Stay with me, as this brings me to my next point.**

There has been an AI hype trade recently, obviously, and I am call bullshit *now*. There is nothing in that NVDA report to suggest that spending on AI infrastructure is manifestly increasing \*in the near term\* at all. The conference call was filled with straight up hopium. The reality is that most tech companies are scaling back their spend on *new* data center infrastructure due to tougher macro conditions. Most earnings calls have made that clear. Ignore the hype, follow the money. Enterprise spend is slowing.

Therefore, the recent AI hype rally irrational exuberance. Remember, when you buy a stock you are paying for future earnings, not Jensen Huang’s hopium laced bathwater. All of a sudden a bunch of normies are excited that ChatGPT can give them a pizza recipe and they think AI is the future of everything. AI was not invented in 2023. These companies have been making these investments for decades, and this hype cycle is not materially changing anything as far as I can tell.

Sure, GOOG feels some more pressure to not shit the bed on execution, but most AI related companies like NVDA are just following their long term plans and acting more conservatively if anything, due to tighter monetary conditions and macro headwinds.

**Oh, did you forget that money is literally not free anymore? This brings me to my final point and play.**

The 6M treasury bill is yielding \~5%. Literally a year ago that shit was basically zero. Therefore, the risk/reward on owning stocks that burn money with no earnings grows more regarded by the day. Furthermore, the economy is holding up better than expected and recently inflation has proved to be stickier than expected, so you bet your left ass cheek that rates are going higher

**Enter: C3.AI (ticker symbol AI).**

This is some shit tier company with literally no moat. They make EnTeRpRiSe Ai FoR HiGh VaLuE UsE CaSeS and their website looks like some coked up incel VC’s wet dream. It IPO’d in 2020 during peak market insanity for billions of dollars and is still worth billions of dollars.

Did you know that it is possible for a company to not be worth billions of dollars? That shit may have flown in a zero rate / free money environment. It is not gonna fly now. But would you look at that, it is up over 100% YTD because of the aforementioned AI hype trade.

This is where rational market participants can take advantage of irrational exuberance using \~\~defined risk strategies\~\~ regarded options plays.

**The play.**

Look at the 4/21 options chain. The 20 strike poot is trading around 2.5, likely lower tomorrow due to the NVDA sympathy pump. This breaks even at 17.5 and gives you 58 DTE. AI was trading around 10 literally last month!!!!! Therefore, I believe the options market is inadequately pricing in the risk of a severe correction / crash in this ticker.

This is not gonna be a 10 bagger due to high IV, but a 1 bagger at 15 is easily doable and a 3-4 bagger is possible if it makes a new 52w low. I like the risk/reward and I DON’T like this low quality AI rally.

Bear case fundamentals: large scale AI adoption actually makes it *harder* for smaller companies to compete, NOT easier. The performance of AI models depends mainly on the quality and amount of the training data. Big tech has a run away advantage here. Everyone is using roughly the same algorithms. Even your whore grandmother is running stochastic gradient descent on her Lenovo Thinkpad these days.

In the words of our lord and savior Jensen Huang, “Large language models are called large because they are quite large.” This is the reason DeepMind (GOOG) came up with the best solution to the protein folding problem with AlphaFold2 in decades, which is arguably the most fundamental and high value problem in molecular biochemistry and biophysics. Data sets are more important than algorithms, so big tech will always win this battle. By the way, AlphaFold came out in 2020, AI is not new jfc.

Bull case fundamentals: they get acquired and ber r fuk.

I will leave you with this quote from a machine learning review am reading: “This is far from the first time we have seen the use of the term artificial intelligence and the grandiose promises that it implies. In fact, the early 1950’s and 1960’s as well as the early 1980’s saw similar AI bubbles (see this interesting summary by Luke Muehlhauser for Open Philanthropy (Muehlhauser, 2016)). These AI bubbles have been followed by what have been dubbed ‘‘AI Winters’’ (McDermott et al., 1985).”

**TL;DR** buy AI 4/21 20p or similar strikes/exps to destroy the AI rally, targeting a 1-2 bagger. Or don’t I’m not your fucking mother.

Positions: I will buy 10x of the aforementioned poots tomorrow. They will likely be on discount due to the NVDA sympathy pump.",EvaUnit343,49,0.79,34,0,0,34,0,2023-02-23T04:40:40Z,Edited,False,t2_5bh1npht,10,10000,1,9653,2020-04-14T14:48:10Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/119on3f/ai_deez_nuts/

119lfom,DD,10 tips to help you lose less money when gambling on stocks:,"**10 tips to help you lose less money when gambling on stocks:**

&#x200B;

**1) Management Assessment:** 

* A strong management team with a track record of success is important. Does the CEO have a history of successfully leading companies & driving growth? Evaluating the CEO's leadership style and decision-making could impact the company's future success.

**2) Insider Activity:** 

* Insiders like the CEO and members of management have access to information that may not be publicly available. When insiders buy or sell shares of their own company, it can signal their confidence or lack of confidence in the company's future prospects.

**3) Investor Analysis:** 

* Institutional investors have a significant impact on stock price. The level of institutional sponsorship provides insights into sentiment and confidence in the company's future. Look for which institutional investors hold the stock and how much they hold.

**4) Strength Assessment:** 

* Identify the company's strengths to assess its potential for long-term success. Evaluate its products or services, brand recognition, patents or factors that set it apart from competitors. Evaluate growth prospects & catalysts to drive future growth.

**5) Growth Potential:** 

* Assessing how the company plans to scale its operations is also critical in evaluating growth potential. Consider any plans to expand into new markets or geographic regions, as well as any potential acquisitions or partnerships that could drive growth.

**6) Earnings Evaluation:** 

* Look for trends in revenue & earnings growth over time. Has the company grown its revenue and earnings over the past several years, or has performance been volatile? Review its record of meeting or missing earnings expectations.

**7) Valuation Comparison:** 

* Compare the company's valuation to its peers or competitors in the industry, such as P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio and the PEG (price-to-earnings growth) ratio. Look for a reasonable valuation relative to its peers.

**8) Stability Assessment:** 

* Review the financial statements to assess financial position & long-term stability. Evaluate financial strength such as positive cash flows from operations, healthy liquidity ratios & manageable debt levels. Look for sustained growth in its financials.

**9) Peer Assessment:** 

* Analyzing a company's competitors and peers is important. Evaluate how the company stacks up against its competitors in terms of financial metrics, products, and competitive landscape. Is there a competitive advantage or a moat?

**10) Event Assessment:** 

* Updated price targets & analysts' ratings can show the potential upside or downside of a stock, but consider the analysts' track record.

119gel0,DD,FOMC Minute day… 2-22-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"Today we finally get the FOMC minutes and here are some highlights from said meeting…

Overall the minutes honestly outside of the fact that a few members wanted a 50bps (which we knew) the minutes were as expected slightly dovish… however, this meeting if you remember is prior to strong jobs numbers, PPI and CPI numbers. I do think we are setting up for a more hawkish tone come next FOMC… depending on what march CPI brings… biggest takes for me is that some members would have voted for 50bps and the tight job market could cause higher and prolonged inflation…

Something I find VERY interesting is that this is apparently the most dovish minutes in 2 years… YET the VIX did not sell off post minutes and spy DID sell off post minutes… VERY interesting to see…

Taking a look at SPY daily here we have so far quite the bearish movement. We have a really nice 4 day long blue bear channel that is very tight and very dramatic right now. One interesting thing to note is that the overall falling wedge that we were in support broke today. Which means we should be looking for a bigger down trend and a bigger bear channel instead of falling wedge. As you can see the potential red bear channel I have here support was even broke today so for now we are trying to establish where this is actually going to go. 

The most important things to note from today is that this is the 4th red day in a row and not only that we attempted ot breakout back over the daily 50/200ema and rejected that. However, we did not quite break through the daily 100ema support at 396.6. As I mentioned before current movement would suggest 390 support retest is inbound. 

Key SPY Support- 398.5 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 394.4 

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.1 -> 405.3

&#x200B;

Same story here on futures we have a very intense black bear channel for 5 days now… and we are looking for futures to close right on the 4000 level right now. 

Futures DID test 100ema here however bounced off of it but more importantly it rejected a breakout back over the daily 50/200ema. We also officially have a 8/ 20ema bearish crossover here too. 

Futures key support- 4000 -> 3985 -> 3965 -> 3945

Futures Key Resistance- 4030 -> 4055

Tesla announced today that its engineering HQ would be in California… short and sweet to the point announcement. 

The biggest thing to note here is that black breakout/ down triangle was officially broke to the downside today. Tesla also attempted to break through and close back over its daily 8ema however was unable to do so. 

Tesla did find a really nice support bounce off that 191.8 support area though. 

Key Tesla Support- 197.4 -> 191.8 -> 183.5

Key Tesla Resistance- 200.8 -> 205 -> 209.2

The VIX honestly is one of the most intriguing things of the day… historically speaking the VIX generally has pretty significant sell offs post FOMC minutes as the “fear” leaves the market and there is very little left to fear… however, today we actually saw the VIX drop slightly and then recover and hold its own. I am interested by the fact that the VIX perfectly touched and rejected 23.6 resistance however did not break yesterdays LOD. The VIX appears for the time being that it has more room to go. 

Tonight afterhours/ tomorrow pre market with nvidia, jobs and GDP is a really big day that I am very curious to see how markets will react/ open. Long term I still expect 390 before 405… however, a relief bounce back to 400 would be warranted.

Actually taking a quick look here at Nvidia earnings their revenue beats might be one of the better earnings reports I have seen all earnings season. That is a fairly impressive report. Nvidia is now testing on the weekly time frame that 215.6 to 230.9 levels.. it has seen two massive rejections up in this level so it will be quite interesting to see what Nvidia does not only tomorrow but Friday.

Overall had a pretty great trading day today.. had some 30-60dte puts that I did close today for some nice wins but also had a few l2l plays intraday. 

Today was tough to trade because we ended up having such aggressive and wild moves price action wise and premium wise it was very difficult to get into some plays… I probably missed at least 6 plays today that woulda been easy 5-10% wins simply because premiums moved so fast I never got filled and by that time it was chasing. No complaints from today for a fed day with elevated IV. 

I remain bearish till we either break back through 405 OR we reach 390… we are currently closed to 390 but I don’t suspect we will reach either by Friday EOD.",DaddyDersch,60,0.9,103,0,1,103,11,2023-02-22T22:43:22Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/119gel0/fomc_minute_day_22223_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/
1199iwu,DD,Potential 22x $RETA puts,"*Disclaimer: high risk play similar in every aspect to an Earnings event.*

&#x200B;

Reata $RETA is a pharma company in the CNS space, currently waiting for PDUFA approval from FDA, expected before 28th February.

The CNS is a particularly difficult space for biotech to get FDA positive news.

1. In fact, after some research, knowledgeable scientists put the odds for $RETA on a 60/40 , basically a binary event, reflected by extreme high IV. Issues on $RETA arise by its cardiotoxicity.

I must add that this is a delayed PDUFA, in those cases the success rate grows historically to 70/30 .

Also, I must add that discussions are being held on a possible FDA shift of policy regarding CNS, meaning more drugs in this space receiving green light.

&#x200B;

I would place a bet at 40% odds if well rewarded. Well, this seems to be the case.

Let's see.

&#x200B;

2) First of all, the option chain is bearish, meaning market is expecting bad news.

[Option chain](http://ibb.co/Ct15gp6)

3) This also means that the bull case is less liquid = spreads are bigger = puts are cheaper than calls.

4) $RETA is currently trading $48.83

Where should it go in both cases ? And will be the bull case rewarded as the bear case ?

&#x200B;

BEAR CASE = PUTS

&#x200B;

$RETA has cash  only for the equivalent of 10$ / share. And that's where the stock price is gonna end in these cases. This means \~ 39 points drop.

Not a case you see everyday !

[PUTS option chain](https://ibb.co/sCvzdf8)

The image refers to the simulated (Theoretical options price on Thinkorswim ) value of the puts after a 38.83 points drop, precisely on the 28th February. If the news come before 28th, the values will be even bigger.

Suggested strike : 5 PUTS MAR17 for an upside of ...

&#x200B;

23x  = 2300 %

Every  $100 should give you $ 2220 .

Net of invested sum and net of commissions.

As you can see, 1 put costs 5$ (+commissions to your broker).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

BULL CASE = CALLS

&#x200B;

I need to add that the upside potential is much less clear than then downside.

RETA could very well explode to 100 or more.

Let's see the 89 stock price here.

&#x200B;

[CALLS option chain](https://ibb.co/wphqZGp)

We start to see the effect of illiquidity and the huge spreads. Hoping to be able getting filled at the mid (while on puts we hit the ask, certain to get a fill) , the best strike would be

75 CALL  MAR17 .

&#x200B;

Minimum capital required \~ $ 450

Upside : 6.7x = 670 % . $ 2550 net.

&#x200B;

Taking the bull side, for the same upside value rounded to 40 points, doesn't pay that much .

And requires much more capital invested.

&#x200B;

If we spent that minimum amount on puts and we took into account the probability of success,

for both cases, what would be the results ?

60/40 : 3996 vs 1530

70/30 : 2997 vs 1785

This encompasses how much better would puts be paid, in case of successful bet.

&#x200B;

Position : long 5 PUTS MAR17 $RETA

1196ogr,DD,SNBR - Sleep Number up 9% going into earnings,"Earnings to be announced after market closes today and already up 9%. Will it keep pumping or dump after the report?

Popular smart bed company Sleep Number sells beds, mattresses, pillows and bedding related products directly to customers via 600+ retail stores, telephone order, and e-commerce. Adjustable temperature, firmness, motion sensing and automatic contouring, even snoring prevention technology are part of their luxury product catering to an aging population in the middle of a health and wellness boom -- with sleep as an increasingly buzzier part of the conversation. Americans buy 16+ million new mattresses a year, spending an average of \~$1000 per unit, making it a $12.55 billion industry. More people are relocating due to job/work-from-home opportunities and changing real estate trends (opting to buy a new mattress instead of moving an old one) -- the projected steady growth could become a surge. SNBR posted beats for the previous 2 Q's.

**Strengths**

* Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.

**Weaknesses**

* Earnings declined over the past year.

**Opportunities**

* Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.
* Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.
* Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.

**Threats**

* Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.
* Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Technically minded investors might also see some promising chart patterns forming as well, and a buying opportunity after a major selloff in the last two years. However, with its recent loss of CFO and announcement that chip shortages were a challenge, an investment in SNBR would not be without uncertainty.

A straightforward short put strategy offers both downside protection and upside potential. Make a fixed 12% (22% annualized) at maturity as long as SNBR does not fall more than 23%.

1195xtb,DD,"Hedge your portfolio against WW3 with $SKYT, a pure play US based semiconductor foundry poised for massive growth this year and next.","&#x200B;

Summary

SkyWater Technology is a US based semiconductor manufacturer, while not yet profitable, will be taking advantage of the CHIPS act funding, and i'm willing to wager that they start mass manufacturing before their expected timeline of 2 years, given the state of the entire world at the moment. They already have active contracts with the DOD, and are actively producing RAD-HARD radiation proof semiconductors to be used in sensitive machinery or defense platforms such as orbital launchers and fighter jets. **oh and the wafer Joe Biden was holding while signing the CHIPS act? That was a SkyWater produced Wafer.** They recently shocked earnings with a beat, with the stock rising 40%. We are still far off from ATHs during the IPO bubble, so this stock in my opinion is ready for huge growth, as the commerce secretary outlines CHIPS act funding later this month: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/commerce-officials-to-detail-chips-act-application-process-this-month-11675780344](https://www.wsj.com/articles/commerce-officials-to-detail-chips-act-application-process-this-month-11675780344)

&#x200B;

Why do I think this stock is a great hedge against WW3? Lets say China invades Taiwan (the main producers of semiconductors). I am willing to bet they would then invoke the defense production act on this company, and basically force them to start producing semiconductors. Economic downturn? Well, the cycle for semiconductor foundries during a downturn is to invest in R&D. Skywaters Advanced Technology Services (R&D) already accounts for 50% of their revenue.  Either way, if none of the above happens, there is still a massive initiative for US based semiconductors. 

Biden holding a SKYWATER wafer:

Taken From a recent article:

The main highlight of SkyWater's business is that they are an active contractor for the US Department of Defense. This positions them well given the current reconfiguration of the semiconductor supply chain. For the DoD, the firm is focused on producing a very specific and strategic kind of computer chip: radiation-hardened. This means that these chips are able to withstand levels of radiation far beyond that of regular computer chips while continuing to operate normally. This kind of chip is designed to work in outer space, as well as other contexts wherein high levels of radiation could occur.

&#x200B;

The company had received an initial commitment of $170M for the development and production of these chips in Q4 2019, with $80M up front. In Q4 2022, the firm announced that the first step of the project had been deemed a success, and the remaining portion of the capital is now set to be paid out.

4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

118fqud,DD,Beary impressive… 2-21-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"After a pretty impressive support bounce on Friday… I am very impressed to see that the bears came out swinging with a -1% red open and even temporarily hit -2% today. Honestly after pretty much two months of buy the dip… I have to 100% hand it to the bears for the work they put in today. 

&#x200B;

Pretty interesting data here showing how strong of bear day we had today. The bulls actually closed out a -2% day… hella impressive.

Tomorrow for those of you who don’t know is FOMC minutes at 2pm… JPOW will NOT be speaking.. its just a release of what was said essentially at the last meeting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30zmulrp1mja1.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f526f7c5b9ce0c98557406e74410b3060984dd9b

Taking a look at SPY daily here we actually are looking at a really impressive down trend over the last 3 days now. Now this blue resistance line sits at 400.2 for tomorrow which means bears got about $1 of upside to still hold same down trend. This also is the first time spy has closed 3 red days in a row since January which funny enough was right after CPI… Actually what truly is crazy is that the trend from last CPI to this CPI is identical. The bears impressively enough were able to close us back under the daily 200ema also today. 

We had a doji CPI day -> small \~0.3% green day -> then 3 red days in a row. 

If trend follows then SPY could be in for a massive green day tomorrow…

We have to factor in FOMC minutes… now that a 50bps hike is on the table (last I checked was about 20% priced in), with CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected and PMI this morning coming in bearish… we very well could see a negative reaction to FOMC minutes. However, much like most FOMC days the reaction to FOMC minutes generally speaking is bullish. 

For me looking at the daily here now that we have lost 405.3 and closed under it I am bearish back to 390. There is always a chance we get a retest of 405.3 resistance first however, losing 405.3 should open up a retest of 390 support. 390 is a major pivot point in this market and depending on our timing reaching it and the next CPI/ FOMC could start a catalyst for further downside or for a recover back to the 400s. 

Key SPY Support- 399.1 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 393.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.2

&#x200B;

Futures actually has a similar looking pattern with a closure under the daily 200ema and this bigger falling wedge pattern you see highlighted in blue. 

With a confirmed rejection of the daily 20ema without ever looking back and presumably the daily 8ema crossing under the daily 20ema tomorrow this is setting up for a bigger bearish drop. 

Bears have upside to 4045 to still holding falling wedge resistance tomorrow. And the falling wedge support will sit at 3990 tomorrow. 

Major downside target would be 3920 support area (similar to that 390 SPY level) if we continue downside. 

Key Futures Support- 4010 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures Resistance- 4032 -> 4055

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/00nhjt6u1mja1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a69fbe40efcd607792710d5f5379645a20b3b113

Taking a look at tesla here (and honestly this goes for the majority of Semis/ tech right now) we are seeing a clear rejection and breakout. 

For Tesla specifically we rejected the daily 200ema last week 3 separate times and despite its best efforts Friday and today was not able to get back there. With Thursday bouncing off the daily 8ema support, Friday closing over daily 8ema and now tesla closing back under daily 8ema support today we should naturally look for a bigger sell off to the daily 20ema. 

There is a bigger breakout triangle formed here on Tesla also. The daily bull channel has been broken as of last week so now our most viable pattern is this break out triangle. Support sits at 197 support tomorrow and resistance at 205. Essentially if Tesla opens or pushes red at all tomorrow we will confirm this breakout/ down triangle pattern and that will lead to further downside. However, if it manages to find support tomorrow and retakes 205 this could be a fake breakdown before a breakout back to that daily 200ema at 215. 

Key Tesla Support- 197 -> 191.9 -> 183.7 -> 181.5  
 Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 214.3

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the VIX here we had that massive breakout of its breakout triangle… with a breakout here and a break down on SPY that could be further confirmation of more downside to come on SPY/ VIX. 

Oddly enough we are nearing that key pivot level on the VIX of 23.6. This is like the soft danger zone… when and if the vix crosses and holds over that level then we will see further downside on SPY and the market as a whole. 

After seeing the VIX relatively flat for the last basically 2 months straight the VIX has had an incredible 28.2% rally from Thursdays low to today HOD. 28.2% in 3 days is pretty incredible. And honestly its more incredible that SPY has only put in one -2% day during that whole time period. 

Actually its pretty incredible that through all of last week with CPI, and PPI that we on a random Tuesday get a -1% red day and the biggest/ worst red day of the year yet… seems a little interesting to me. 

**Daily log-**

I swang futures calls this weekend and honestly I never looking at the VIX and spy on Friday would have suspected that we would close a -2% red day… at all. I would take that swing again and again. However, futures showed quite a bit of weakness throughout the weekend but oddly everytime it was looking ready to breakout it just kept getting slapped down over the holiday trading hours. But open it was so far gone that I was hoping for a small relief rally at open to mitigate some loss but PMI took us straight down and it was all over from there. 

After that honestly intraday trading today was not that bad. However, I would have been better off if I stopped trading at 12pm after my 6 wins a row (had a nice intraday streak of 14 wins in a row going). However, that 1245am reversal I had entered a put and fully expected a relief rally up to the 15min 20ema so mitigated my loss (so I thought) I then bit the call bullet thinking when we closed over 8ema that we would continue to breakout, however, we immediately double topped and I shoulda just stuck to my original thesis. 

Looking back I should have trusted VOLD more during that time period and while I was fighting trend slightly a relief rally is expected most days to the 20ema and the fact that we didn’t get that actually is even more impressive of a red day today. 

Overall not a bad day IV was also elevated today because of FOMC minutes tomorrow which did make the payout for options less than desirable after the bigger morning pushes.",DaddyDersch,37,0.93,112,0,0,112,7,2023-02-21T21:34:34Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/118fqud/beary_impressive_22123_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/

1184geo,DD,Stock Ideas for the Week,"**BKI** \- They have an acquisition agreement in place with $ICE to get acquired for $83. They are currently trading at about $64, a 30% discount due to concerns the acquisition will get blocked. BKI is really trying to get this through and even is looking to sell off one of its business units to help alleviate anti-competitive concerns. Michael Burry also made it his second-largest holding 

**EXPE** \- Google appears to be stepping way back on travel (fired a bunch of the Google Flights team and removed features like Book w/ Google and Trips w/ Google) which greatly reduced competition. They are also lagging way behind BKNG (-45% over the last 6 months v +4% for GOOGL) and ABNB had killer earnings which could be promising for the sector

**TOST** \- Got crushed after missing bottomline estimates (even though they didn't lower guidance like many companies did - including many companies that popped after barely beating lowered guidance). They are growing very fast (+60% rev growth, +40% new store growth) and beat topline estimates, which they actually had raised. They are a growth co actually performing well in this environment.

There is now some insane option action with:

* 32,000 vol on the March $3 strike
* 62,000 vol on April $2 strike

Based on the recent acquisition of Oak Street Health by CVS for a similar-sized business potential, this could be a multi-Xer. God speed.

116fkdl,DD,We got a leg down on deck folks!," 

Since ya'll loved my last post so much I'm here to indulge you once more

We ended up having a complete range week this past week and were close to forming an inside bar on the weekly chart. Undercutting the prior week's low by not even a dollar on the SPY and closing just below last week's closing print. So I suppose yes I was right, last week was indeed a red week

***I am officially 1/1 on my weekly predictions…***

However! I do hope you paid attention to the levels outlined in last week's post as the levels mentioned were on point.

>It is possible that we base here for a few days and make a shot at a move higher. If that’s the case, watch closely how price reacts in the 410-415 area. If toppy and is clearly selling this would be a great area to get a short position.

This was the trade of the week here in the markets last week.

Monday we saw a rally all day with a bid holding into the CPI announcement. CPI came in greater than expected and was initially bought than sold. We saw a retest of our 410 line in the sand and hold with a relatively flat close on the day.

Wednesday another hold of 410 off of the open, trading back towards that 414 liquidity mentioned in last week's post with a failure to hold.

Thursday’s Premarket session put an end to the grinding action which we had the first half of the week undercutting our higher lows set at 408 & 409.5, opening the market with the biggest gap of the week. We saw an all day rally yet again Thursday grinding into the close with the last hour of action giving it all back and closing at new lows.

Friday we saw this continued action with another gap down in the markets. We traded to the new 404 demand zone noted in last week's post and more or less held that range the entire day before pushing into the close.

There was plenty of action last week to be had! We don’t need a huge directional move in the markets each week to make money. Having levels drawn out and understanding the general narrative of the markets at any given time can help you capitalize on the volatility.

Top Down Analysis

Moving on to our coming week's Top Down Analysis!

Overall my macro thesis is still intact. If you didn’t read last week's post then I’ll fill us in quickly. Longer term for the year 2023 I am indeed bullish and believe we end the year higher. However, on a week to week basis which direction we trade in is up for grabs and I’m simply making an educated guess based on technicals and upcoming economical data.

Our weekly chart is still intact. We have fresh swing lows on the weekly chart which have been built out. More recently in the last month, we took out that 410 pivot high which was our first higher high in the past year.

You can see we’re still holding above the past year's macro downtrend line as well as holding above the 200 daily moving average.

https://preview.redd.it/sktzxdts26ja1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed49bd26f5aac41ecc6ef9d921a499318de44b37

The main thing I’d like to see here from a macro view is any future swing low set above 380. I do think it’s possible we pull back below this 400 level as well as the 200 daily moving average etc. Any swing low set over 380 however keeps the bull thesis intact and keeps us moving in the right direction.

Zooming In

Taking a look at our daily chart. We see that we may possibly be getting some topping action coming into play once again at this 410 level. We’ve had three prior failed breakouts of this 410 level and this current attempt does not look like it’s breaking that trend at the moment.

https://preview.redd.it/bqtol2xt26ja1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c1f29cb514358ef810b2abe1b726375f4ab47a18

We have not yet lost the 20 daily moving average but we were close to it on Friday. The prior three failed breakouts at 410 were confirmed by a close under the 20 daily moving average and will be my signal to be risk off any long swings until we reclaim.

Taking an even closer look we can see that we’re currently in a trading range between 404 and 415ish. The demand created on the up move two weeks ago to break above our prior swing high of 410 started from 404. This level has now been held twice in the last two weeks.

This coming week the real tell will be if we can continue to hold above this 404 level and make a move through the supply at 410-415. I have a bit of an overall bias to the downside before we see any type of significant move up. As said above I don’t think we see armageddon but a move to undercut these lows down to 390 -395 would be very constructive.

https://preview.redd.it/3sq943xu26ja1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa47d843147c08c94d0d065ccfde170e128bc6a

Some key levels for you to keep an eye on this coming week would be 404 current demand as well as any move back into 410-415. Overall we are setting lower highs with several failed attempts to hold over 415. We’ve found good support here at 404 but as time goes on and the inability to hold higher this support level will indeed weaken.

https://preview.redd.it/6326i12w26ja1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ae3b42d9c5d8ca08cce8d0c60b72372a4e75374

These are levels as well as the narrative to which I am paying attention too and I am happy to share them.

115zjcm,DD,Shorting Walmart (Future play),"On Monday, before the market closes. I will be shorting Walmart. I believe this is the strategy to do because Walmart earnings are realizing Tuesday which I believe will be 50% less than expected resulting in an immediate crash. I believe Walmart will crash because of the following:

- Walmart locations: 10,500
- Potential Growth: 0
Reason: 10,500 is a lot of stores, they have already saturated the US market. They have no where else to expand.

- Walmart employees: Local
- Good or Bad: Bad because the locals care about the community resulting in empathy. Empathy is bad for business.

- Customers: a lot
- projection: less
Reason: have you seen how little people go to Walmart recently? There’s alot but it’s on the downward spiral.

Conclusion: No growth potential, bad employees, to little costumers. Get ahead while you can and do what I do.",placeholder398,105,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,2023-02-19T02:47:08Z,False,False,t2_viqdhmwf,20,11,4,8,2023-01-12T14:56:54Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/115zjcm/shorting_walmart_future_play/

1151x2q,DD,The bulls are NOT done just yet…. 2-17-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Recap and Analysis,"Now yesterday in my TA I misspoke… I meant to say “the nail in the BULLS coffin.” However, I was in a rush to get that out leaving for gymnastics with my daughter and mistyped “the nail in the BEARS” coffin… but funny enough I actually correctly mistyped… what I means is that I actually am bullish here for next week. 

So lets talk about what happened yesterday with the 50bps rate hike rumors… now Bullard from what I understand actually hinted at that at last meeting and markets did not react. Now the market FINALLY with CPI, PPI and the 50bps took an absolute nose dive. Now the very interesting this is that despite that yesterday markets still found itself in a buy the dip movement today. 

Think about it this way… markets have pretty much been on edge all week long and realistically were hella overdue for a technical support sell off and retesting of key support in order to push higher… that 50bps hike was the catalyst. However, markets came to their senses in my opinion and realized that those two fed members don’t even get a vote… markets realized also that realistically we have another CPI before FOMC and honestly the sell off MIGHT be slightly premature… there is a very high probability that until next CPI and FOMC we find ourselves in a very broad $10-$15 consolidation period like we have now. IT makes trading extremely hard but as of right now there is not enough bull fuel to take this rally to 430 but there really isn’t enough fuel either to take us back to 390…. Enters consolidation… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gapl16bvauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c82ffb0ecb65750dcc6a36dcddb8b520114abdc5

Now earlier this week I asked the question “is 405 or 420 coming next?” well we officially have the answer that 405 was coming first… with 405 tagged and most importantly that support holding there is a high probability this push up continues next week. 

I remain bullish but only in the sense that I believe much like November to December we have found ourselves in a bigger consolidation range from 406 to 417.

This is now our 2nd retest and most importantly our second time holding 405.3 support on a breakdown. I fully expect upside early next week into FOMC minutes on Wednesday. 

Remember we get a really long weekend here too… generally speaking I would say most 3 day weekends have resulted in bigger green days and opens. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny611tqvauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b7b8f42cfd4b52739c14212748c92cc106ad240

Economic data wise not a whole lot and nothing pre market Tuesday. FOMC minutes is on Wednesday though. 

Today was monthly options expiration and honestly it was a pretty boring day overall pretty tight $3.46 range day. 

Lets take a look at the last few monthly OPEX days… 

January 20th (opex)= 1.86%+  
 January 23rd (post- OPEX)= 1.2%

December 16th (OPEX)= -1.63%  
 December 19th (post- OPEX)= -0.85%

November 18th (OPEX)= 0.45%+  
 November 21st (post- OPEX)= -0.36%  
 

Overall looking at the last 3 MOPEX… there is literally trend at all… however of the last two MOPEX this is definitely one of the smaller movement days. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wmicet5wauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ab89b73584f32433caf88e8086dc4003f06168d

Now lets take a look here at SPY daily…

Overall we broke through that bull channel support but as I have highlighted here with that black arrows we actually look like we are in an overall upchannel and this very well with retaking the daily 20ema there EOD could end up being a bullish bounce. 

I have mentioned the importance of that 405.3 support area and how as long as we hold that we are bullish. 

You can see that double level at 410.3 to 411.3 and that should be our expected magnet. As in the further we get away from that +/- we SHOULD expect a rebound back to it. 

Todays daily candle structure today with this upside gap of 407.51 to 408.18 actually forms an amazing bullish abandoned baby pattern. This is a high probability upside reversal pattern. I feel fairly confident that we will minimally Tuesday touch somewhere between 408 to 410.3. From there we then start looking at a daily 8ema resistance retest. A closure back over that is extremely bullish however a closure under it/ rejection at it would be very bearish. There is also an overall with the red channel bigger bull flag pattern forming on SPY daily here too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/btxvdmlwauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79bf867616a98f7e8e4f6c5ac77f2aeee5a30a59

Now the weekly chart here is actually starting to look a little more bearish. However, if you look at the week of December 19th and 27th we are actually seeing a similar pattern here and with this holding the weekly 8ema support this could be an overall bigger weekly bull flag too. The upside push would get us back to that 417+ area. 

Taking a look here this 407 area has really solidified itself as a major pivot area here. Looking at the resistance from the week of November 28th you can see we actually have a really nice support bounce off that level here this week. After a breakout the week of January 30th over that level this very well could be shaping up to be a bullish support bounce and we attempt once more to reach the allusive 420. 

Key SPY Weekly Support- 407.1 -> 402.6 -> 398.6 -> 395.6

Key SPY Weekly Resistance- 412.3 -> 417 -> 422.4 -> 427.7

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0vtkkcaxauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=244c856f497d791faa3d20d6ef8802bb1bf881b5

I actually looking at the futures daily chart am even more bullish than I am on SPY daily… and here is why… so we look at this 4085 level I have mentioned numerous times that that 4085 to 4095 is a major level to keep an eye on and I also mentioned that realistically there is not much contested support from 4040 to 4085. 

Today we came down all the way back to 4055 before we finally bounced… not only that but we ended up in a massive absolutely beautiful morning doji star reversal candle. With this reversal candle like this we should expect a push back up to that 4120 area. This 4085 support area if you look back at it was first rejected on January 27th. And then on FOMC day feb 1st we bounced off and confirmed that as support again. Much like on February 10th we had a biggest retrace and then bounce off these 4085 support area. Now that this daily candle body failed to break that key support and we have a massive wick to the downside we should expect a push back into the 4100s minimally next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s7i0n8txauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a7cfeb7027d500ab4eb80afc1b5e2289e3b02a88

Now the weekly futures chart here is a bit of a mixed bag here… on one hand we hard rejected that 4150 level 3 weeks ago and now have lost that key support area of 4095 and failed to close back over it to end the week. However, when we look back at the week of November 28th/ December 5th it established the key level of 4075 and that level was retested and confirmed on the week of January 30th. With futures failing to close under key 4075 and bouncing off the weekly 8ema one could assume that there will be an upside push next week to retest that 4150 resistance area. Again there is a convincing case of a bull flag here on the weekly chart. 

Key Futures weekly support- 4075 -> 4020 -> 3970 -> 3920

Key Futures weekly resistance- 4095 -> 4150 -> 4225

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0s07l3cyauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=064ec185007cd44e11b11d7f9ee30debbf7effa4

Looking at tesla here we are seeing that we did once again break through support here on the bull channel but impressively after losing the daily 8ema at open and opening under it and rejecting that key 201.9 resistance for a while today we have found ourselves once again on a move to 215 next week. 

215 remains an absolute brick wall which actually reminds me a lot of the fight at 197. IF bulls can break through that level then we could see quite the blow off top before we finally see a major correction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c2t931yyauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80bebb38bed6f3fe761e1df5316520485a8d56cf

The weekly on tesla is actually fairly bullish here. We had a breakout and rejection of that weekly 50ema and after last week forming that potential reversal doji candle the bulls managed to hold the weekly 200ema support retest. The fact that bulls continued to hold that weekly support remains bullish. However we have now come into this major 208.4 resistance level from November 7th. If bulls can break through that and close over that we might see a bigger push for that weekly 100ema at 223.5.

Key Tesla weekly support- 197.4 -> 189.6 -> 178.2

Key Tesla weekly resistance- 208.4 -> 226.4

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uqafx1x0buia1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ac1414b25941aa480175705fdf12913a23ac7ae

So I have mentioned before that if SPY/ Futures is showing a reversal pattern (such as the abandoned baby/ morning doji star) and the VIX is showing the opposite pattern which currently its showing a evening doji star reversal (granted this candle body is very long for the true pattern… but with the failure to breakout and bigger reversal the pattern is there just not the physical candle structure) then there is a very high probability swing play. 

With the VIX having that massive 10.65% green double bottom yesterday and for most of the day threatening to breakout to that key 21.5 resistance but failing to do so and closing back at 20 we should expect a continuation sell off next week (on the VIX) which then should provide an upside push on SPY itself. 

We have seen these inverse reversal patterns (where spy shows the opposite reversal pattern to VIX ) play out time and time again. It is one of the highest probability setups we have and I will happily take it every time. 

**Weekly log-**

Overall not the best week of trading here… unfortunately put in three red days in a row (no help to CPI swing) to start the week off. That really put me in a pretty good sized hole. However with all things considered Thursday and Friday had a 100% win rate and I was able to be extremely profitable and close at a relatively small loss for the week. 

My biggest struggle this week came with that 11am to really 2pm price action. We found ourselves much like today stuck in some extreme choppy ranges that couldn’t quite break out. 

My biggest struggle this week came from the physical price action that we saw not being complimented by indicators and overall movement on SPY. Definitely a tough week but after three really tough days to start the week I was happy to finish the week on a strong note. It was refreshing to through drawdown stick to my rules and be able to turn in some really nice plays to end the week. 

Overall despite a red week i obeyed my rules, I didn’t break my rules and I have no regrets. Honestly even playing CPI lotto puts I have no regrets. When we look at the PPI reaction its actually mind boggling that a hotter PPI got a bigger bear reaction that physical CPI did… actually what is even more mind boggling is the fact that a non voting fed members whispering 50bps hike can elicit a bigger reaction that hard cold data like CPI can… but that’s the way these algos work.

114uxbd,DD,"It takes longer than you think, why the market won't bottom until Q1 2025","This is not financial advice, just my opinion. 

There have been 3 major bubbles in the last 2 decades.

1.) Dot-com bubble 1998-2000

2.) Housing bubble 2004 to 2006

3.) Covid everything bubble 2020 to 2022


**Key Indicator - 10 year treasury minus 3 month treasury inverted yield curve**

The most accurate recession signal is the 10 year less 3 month treasury curve. Every time this has inverted, a recession followed within 12 months on average. This indicator is 8/8 historically.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M



**2000 Dot-com**


Inverted July 2000

Recession begins March 2001

Market bottomed October 2000 - 26 months after inversion


**2006 Housing Bubble**

Inverted July 2006

Recession begins December 2007

Market bottoms February 2009 - 30 months after inversion


**2022 Everything Bubble**

Inverted October 2022

Recession likely to begin between Q4 2023 to Q1 2024

Market bottoms December 2024 to April 2025 - 26 to 30 months after inversion

The leading cause of the 2006 housing bubble was 3 year teaser rates for single family ARM loans. When the fixed period expired, borrowers couldn't pay the floating rate. The leading cause of this bubble popping will be Commerical Real Estate, not single family. Single family has low supply, low % of ARMs, and most borrowers fixed for 30 years at record low rates. 

On the other hand, the so called ""Professionals"" got greedy. The narrative of ""interests rates will be low forever"" permeated the industry all the way up to Summer 2022. Most institutional buyers, funds, and developers use floating debt. In 2019 this figure was at nearly 35%.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-interest-rates-hit-landlords-who-cant-afford-hedging-costs-11673900169

The catch is they typically buy a rate cap to hedge against rising interest rates. This is typically 2 to 3 years in duration, and then they either have to buy another rate cap, which has risen 10x at least in price, they have to refinance (which they can't meet DSCR at higher rates), or they have to sell into a weak market.

Office AND Multifamily will lead the pack in losses for different reasons.

**Office**

Office owners are currently in a stalemate with investors and lenders. No one wants to blink first. The banks are pushing back to office narrative because they are the bagholders, office lending was the bread and butter for them for the last decade, especially for smaller regional banks. The few office sales that have occurred at down anywhere from 20% to 50%, often from values as long ago as 2014.

For office owners, the pain is three fold. 

1.) Leases - companies continue to shrink their footprint as leases expire. Roughly 900 million square feet of office leases expire by 2025.

2.) Values - No one truly knows how far these have fallen since sales volume has been so muted. The range has the potential to be massive, anywhere from 20% to 50% loss in pre-covid values.

3.) Debt - In 2023 alone roughly $100 billion is coming due for office alone, nearly $270B in CRE total, and this will accelerate through 2025. 
https://www.barrons.com/articles/nyc-real-estate-market-a52c10cd

**Multifamily**

Multifamily has better fundamentals than Office, but greed was rampant during 2020 to H1 2022. 

**Issue #1 - Value add deals (1960s to 1980s vintage)**

These were purchased primarily at low to mid 3% cap rates (6% pre covid).

CPI data shows rents growing at 8% MoM but this data is lagged. Private market data shows rents have been falling since October 2022.

For value add owners, rents are falling or stagnant at best, while facing exorbitant increases in expenses. Older properties require significant deferred maintenance, cap ex, etc. Taxes, insurance, and renovations are up double digits YoY squeezing their bottom lines. These value add deals also primarily used bridge financing with 2 year or 3 year rate caps. Peak sales volume was Q1 2021 to Q2 2022, meaning credit losses will start in early 2024 and accelerate through Q2 2025 as rate caps expire.

**Issue #2 - Class A New Construction**

The biggest lie in real estate is that we have a housing shortage. The truth is we have some self imposed local housing shortages in strict zoning markets such as LA, NYC, SF, etc. For most markets, vacancy is already approaching its long term average, and will soon be higher than historical ranges.

On the other hand, we have the most housing under construction in over 40 years. This will start to deliver Q2 2023 and accelerate through Q3 2024.

Class A rents are already falling, and we have nearly 1M new units delivering over the next 18 months. Historically we average 300k units per year. Developers got flooded with money and did what they do best - build.

Most developers use floating rates or have rate caps as well. These will expire during a difficult lease up environment to compound the issues.

**Timeline**

In 2023 we have ongoing rate hikes, Fed QT $1 trillion per year, and stubborn inflation pushing the Fed to keep going.

To make it worse for the CRE industry, the fundamentals are already weakening before record new supply has even delivered. On top of that, record loan volume will adjust to floating rates as rate caps expire in 2024.

TLDR: Office owners go broke, multifamily buyers during covid may go broke, fuck your near term puts.

114tc8q,DD,MarineMax (HZO) is a good buy,"Yes, that's the entire title.

Who spends the most money? Rich people. What do rich people like to buy? Boats, of course. Now think of any boat-related business. MarineMax, $HZO, probably does it. Yacht sales? They do that. Used boat sales? Yep! Boat maintenance and repairs? Sure thing! They even own marinas!

&#x200B;

# Why I like MarineMax

MarineMax's earnings are growing, like really really fast. Their sales are up from $750 million in 2015 to just over 2.3 billion last year, a CAGR of 16%. Additionally, MarineMax saw its pre-tax revenue grow 250% since 2020, with a revenue CAGR of 44%. The difference in their growth rates for sales and revenue are likely cause by their expanding margins, acquisitions of new companies, and 75% increase in average store revenue since 2015.

That brings me to the second reason to like MarineMax. The company has acquired 14 new holdings since April of 2019, many of which help them expand into businesses other than boat sales, such as insurance, boat construction, marinas, and technology. These interests have better margins than the new boat sales they currently rely on, and put MarineMax in a position to expand sales and revenue even further in the near future.

# The Catch

As you might expect, acquiring 14 companies in 4 years puts some strain on the balance sheet. While MarineMax currently has a net debt to equity ratio around 75%, its interest payments are covered 21.5x by EBIT, which I believe represents responsible, opportunistic use of debt to expand the company.

# The Value

MarineMax currently looks very good from a valuation standpoint. MarineMax currently has a book value of around 37 dollars per share. MarineMax, currently stands at around 33 dollars per share, giving it a price/book ratio of around 0.90. The companies current book value exceeds the stock price. Now, factor in their strong sales, revenue, and margin growth, and this is starting to look good. Throw in a PE of 4, far under the Marine Sales industry average of 11, and this looks promising. How about a Price/Earnings growth of around .15? Or maybe you'd be interested in a price to sales of .3 to go along with those expanding margins? What more could you possibly be waiting for, someone to give it to you for free?

# The Invitation

This isn't a typical WSB stock. It isn't super volatile, and its options kinda suck, but now's the time. Trade in those crayons for some boat wax (just don't eat it)! You never know, maybe you'll be the one buying one of those cool yachts in 5 years, just set down the puts and give it a shot. What do you have to lose that you weren't most likely going to lose anyway?

TLDR; MarineMax (HZO) is a pretty darn good buy (but if it loses money I didn't tell you to buy it)

114o9r8,DD,Cineplex upside potential,"Cineplex ([CGX.TO](https://CGX.TO)) has a monopoly of theaters in Canada. They were hit hard during covid and now they carry a heavy debt load pushing their stock price down.

However there are strong signs of a recovery and the stock has beat analyst estimates the last 3 times. They also won their lawsuit against Cineworld and are supposed to receive 1.2B cdn however Cineworld is undergoing bankruptcy fillings. There is some light in the tunnel as Cineworld may emerge from its bankruptcy. If this happens then it is possible Cineplex could receive some of the money due them and it could wipe out 70% of their debt.

In terms of profitability, Cineplex has been generating positive free cash flow and the main drag/risks are interest rates to this stock since they have such a high debt load, an increase in interest rates would hurt the stock price.

Cineplex also owns other businesses such as Player One Amusement which is the sole provider of some brands of arcade/pinball machines in Canada as well as restaurant business like the RecRoom.

I personally like this stock and think it has a lot of upside potential despite the shorts.

&#x200B;

So this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y13euelymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=074aab4603aac6ebb22c8742d06ee325a9a7b1ae

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/srxx5orlymia1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b47cfba028b2d0d4685bf6893714f526afded492

Something I don’t talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it… SPY rallied too… those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing… that market reaction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5xzmx6mymia1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8baa7a27a6d38e1a843f4a4d516abece0d69f66

Now here is something very interesting to think about… We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the “end” however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eabedxkmymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a6f5d020f5548567d41718adf38bf2c1c557bff

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn’t even in question. 

So the question now remains… did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow…

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different… we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not…

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today… this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day.

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased.

One kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow… that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. 

I wouldn’t be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books… 

Tomorrow could be one extremely volatile day…

After a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day… sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me. No complaints at all. 

Interestingly enough I took the first two trades before 1030 am and didn’t take that last one until 1pm. I just as much as I knew it was a buy the dip day there just was zero movement. 

Pretty much from 11am until 1215pm it was untradable and then we were looking for that bigger EOD bounce after Biden briefed us on aliens and well that never came. I have a pretty hard fast rule of Not trading power hour… have been burnt WAY too many times and was happy to sit it out even though I would have liked to have entered a put. 

I did take a put end of date on futures that I just closed out a 20.3%... will include that in tomorows log as that was technically a swing play and closed after markets closed at 415pm for the day. 

Overall tomorrow is Friday and it should be a wild end to the week. 

To me… a closure under 408.8 is very bearish for next week and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see a bigger sell off next week. 

If by some chance the bulls can once again buy the dip and put this back over 410 we might see some upside next week or find ourselves once again in another sideways week.",DaddyDersch,173,0.87,312,0,3,312,12,2023-02-16T23:34:41Z,False,False,t2_6piw14v8,1417,9919,458,4919,2021-01-27T23:23:09Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/
1144l0m,DD,50 BPS Hike… the nail in the bear coffin… 2-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"So this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound!

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail…

Something I don’t talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it… SPY rallied too… those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing… that market reaction.

Now here is something very interesting to think about… We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the “end” however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes…

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn’t even in question. 

So the question now remains… did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow…

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different… we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not…

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today… this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day.

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased.

113z6o4,DD,ARCH: A Black Diamond,"  

**TLDR** – Arch Resources (**ARCH**) is a Coalmine Owner-Operator currently valued at only 2.5x earnings compared to peers Peabody (BTU) at 3.5x and Consol (CEIX) at 4.5x earnings. This company is kicking off crazy earnings numbers and forecasts support continued strong earnings. I don’t think that level of cash generation is currently wrapped into the price. The name is a consensus buy by all the banks and has 90%+ of institutional ownership. Hedge funds are taking new positions in the company frequently and I believe they see the same thing. The relatively under-the-radar nature of this sector makes price discovery a somewhat slow and tricky process. I believe this company should be trading close to $200/ share, which would bring it close to 3x earnings. Earnings were reported today which they crushed on (explains the price runup) but I believe there is meaningful upside as a short-to-mid-term trade to get exposure to both the energy transition play, and the industrial / building boom we’re expected to see with electrification.

Bad timing to write this given today’s runup in the name, but given you guys like buying things that are already at all-time-highs, hear me out.

Energy has been a huge trade over the last year, there’s been murmuring about the trade being done, all the juice being squeezed out of it. Maybe, but Texas Tea’s ugly cousin still looks cheap. I’m talking about coal. Obviously coal is one of the most ethically deplorable things out there, or at least that’s how it’s portrayed in the media, but how are we supposed to arrive at “Net Zero” without use of cheap, transitional energy sources like coal, especially ones that have other uses (steelmaking). Out of all the energy sectors, coal is one of the cheapest from a valuation standpoint, trading at only 2-5x earnings, which is INSANE given the amount of cashflow these guys are kicking off. The company that looks most promising – ARCH. Arch Resources owns and operates coal mines primarily in the great US of A. Arch enjoys one of the lowest cost positions in the country on Metallurgical Coal, which is used for steelmaking. Arch also produces Thermal coal in a lower proportion. Coal has seen a runup in price over the last couple years and some of that has reverted to the mean, but Coal has room to keep running. Some of the mitigating factors: supply chain / manufacturing is still getting up to speed post the ‘vid, and China reopening is still a wildcard, as they’re the world’s biggest purchaser of coal (China produces roughly half of the world’s steel). If China continues their return to normal as expected, I believe the runway will bust wide open. Side note for you out there who like to make crayon drawings on charts, relative strength is at 82 as of today.

Arch management has been in the game for a long time, they know coal isn’t our future, so they’re strategically spending their money in ways that make sense – you can see this in their uses of cash. They’re spending on inventories as the demand for coal and energy broadly is experiencing its’ time in the sun, but they aren’t incessantly throwing money at growth Capex – only enough to keep their assets maintained and productive (look at depreciation and Capex lines below). They also know that the broader coal production industry has been under-investing in coal-producing assets which can only be a good thing for ARCH as they will be ready to capitalize on improved market dynamics related to the supply-demand of coal.

Let’s talk about risks – only fitting as the company exited bankruptcy protection in 2016 after the metallurgical coal market saw a turn in its’ fortunes following one of the best times in recent history. Keep in mind that ARCH had a whopping $5 BILLION of debt at that point. Arch now carries a very low amount of debt given their level of earnings – currently having more cash ($236mm) than debt ($174mm) which is in line with their business plan. Rule of thumb is for high business risk companies (physical asset intensive, cyclical) companies to not carry a lot of financial risk, or leverage. You’ll notice below is the excessive interest coverage levels (EBITDA / Interest Expense) of 10.7x. This company’s not going anywhere and you can stress earnings levels all you want – there’s plenty of wiggle room.

Finally, what is going to cause value recognition to take place? There needs to be a catalyst. Firstly, most of the ownership in the stock has been sitting in the name for quite some time. ARCH has had upwards of 80%+ institutional ownership for years. The company is currently creating value over and above its cost of capital and I don’t believe that’s fully been recognized in the price yet, especially not after today’s earnings. This may not happen overnight, but I’m convinced this is a winner. The stock currently has a 7.7% dividend on it. I’m glad getting paid to wait.

It’s hard to say how long price discovery takes in names like this. It doesn’t trade with crazy high volume, but it also isn’t a penny stock – this thing has fairly liquid, and somewhat cheap options (!!) and is a months to a year long play in my view. Leaves some room for some interesting stock / option trades.

Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I have a current long position in ARCH (own the stock).",emb59523,7,0.72,5,0,0,5,5,2023-02-16T19:44:04Z,False,False,t2_5jrksysy,1,2,1,2,2020-03-16T04:11:55Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/113z6o4/arch_a_black_diamond/

113geh5,DD,China Gov't is broke be aware! The signs are there.,"Disclaimer: Most not all of you WSB'ers didn't believe me when I posted about Pfizer earlier in the year so hear this now a second heads up for you guys.   

Note relating to China: A few months ago I let you guys know that the rumors in many circles was that the real reason why China stopped Zero Covid policy was actually because the Chinese govt had run out of money to keep paying the medical and social security for the elderly, they needed people to die so that they could potentially balance their books as there would be fewer people they would have to support.  It appears rumors might well be true and the Crap has begun to hit the fan. Apparently, In a twist of irony, the govt of Wuhan (where covid started) announced that they would have to make cuts to people's medical benefits (I.E. their equivalent of Medicare) and it has sparked mass protests outside govt buildings. See link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buBqcRgFReo&feature=youtu.be]

So How does that affect us, traders and investors?

1.  Media outlets have not yet picked up on this development and financial networks and analysts are too busy trying to “talk up” China stocks.

2. If this is truly happening and cuts are being made then that shortfall in coverage will have to be made up somewhere and it won't come from the elderly or gov’t.

3. The shortfall in coverage will be made up from the younger generation now having to take their earnings and support their elderly parents and grandparents.

4. That means all those young people working will not be consuming and adding to the economy and that will spell trouble for the likes to BABA, NIO, PDD, EEM, ASHR just to name a few.

5. Chinese are very protective and respectful of their elders and they will not be able to watch their elders suffer so they will have to pony up the cash to support them.

6. The hospital system in China is a “cash” system you either have the funds or you don’t, the “health insurance system” exists but it doesn’t even factor in that’s how small it is. If you don’t have the cash to pay for your needs you go to the back of the line even if your hand is severed from your wrist (which I have seen in person). This means when these elderly go to the hospital and they are short on funds there is only one other source they can rely on and it will be young family.

7. There likely won’t be any real heavy coverage on this subject as the China govt will not want to lose face but the point I am making is at a certain point the consumption the west is expecting from the young workers WILL NOT be there as they will be pre-occupied with keeping their mom and dad alive.

8. On a personal experience with an emergency health issue in China, back in 2005 I had appendicitis and an appendix that was about to burst, I went to the hospital and they took me in but as I am in the emergency room the admin ppl are swiping all my credit cards running back and forth from the examination room to the cashier making me sign all the receipts, all while I’m being examined to make sure I was paid up before they sent me up to the operating room. 

9. I am not talking down on the system in China it's just the way the system works, sometimes good sometimes bad. Good being when I first sprained my ankle in China I thought my X-ray would cost a fortune (like in the U.S.) and it only cost $5 USD I was pleasantly surprised.

10. Watch out this could catch the markets off guard, I was early in reporting the Pfizer news earlier this year keep your eye open and get ready there might be a big rug pull at some point.",Coconutisagiantnut1,118,0.78,74,0,0,74,0,2023-02-16T03:07:20Z,False,False,t2_a14w48wi,19,20,15,18,2021-01-30T14:04:29Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/113geh5/china_govt_is_broke_be_aware_the_signs_are_there/

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%.

1139q8l,DD,Buy the dip continues… 2-15-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"Today was another one of those days where it was a clear buy the dip narrative. However, it was clearly not presented that way yet again. Now I know basically for the last week or 2 its been every dip is a rip… and honestly IF you went into the day with only the mentality that every dip is an opportunity for a call and you didn’t look at any other technicals or supporting evidence then you would probably be profitable. 

However, these sell offs are becoming more and more convincing and more and more supported from a technical standpoint. This isnt just a small retrace in price action to reconfirm support. These are pretty large retraces taking out major support and having a lot of supporting technical that they will continue. However, much like yesterday as soon as those technical show continuation we are getting absolutely rogue out of no where rips and then eventually technical come back to support the bull side. 

IT has become increasingly frustrating to trade SPY over the last 2 weeks now. There is absolutely no continuation and the technicals just don’t make a whole lot of sense at all. Major supports/ resistances breaking with support of price action and technicals are seeing rogue reversals before we finally get the actual movement one would expect. 

The more I look at the last 2 weeks of price action we are stuck in a range. However, this range is heavily being held together by the buy the dip narrative. There has been countless opportunities and supporting evidence of a large correction sub 405 coming on SPY since last week and we still manage to stay afloat some how. 

&#x200B;

We do get some more data in the AM with initial jobless claims and PPI. Will be curious if this PPI final demand expected a 0.4% with a previous of -0.5% will be negatively received… the feds have said how much they rely on PPI so a hotter or rebounding PPI COULD potentially finally see a retrace. 

But that’s only if the buy the dip narrative ends… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/za8k35dccfia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=72fc0880713eee2a1189f09d8486eda10d9ecb97

Looking at SPY here that range I am referring to since February 1st is 405 to 417. 

Overall we haven’t broken through either of those levels over the last 11 trading days now. The question still does remain 420 or 405 next? The case for 420 grows in my opinion. 

Something I wanted to highlight here on SPY was the post CPI trends from December and January. In December we had that CPI day that resulted in that massive candle. The following day we closed a small red day and then the day after that was a massive red day. Looking at January we had that range day much like this previous CPI yesterday. The next day was a bullish engulfing day (much like today). The following day resulted in a reversal doji that then was proceeded by a huge sell off. 

I will be curious to see if this trend continues or not. 

When we look at the daily we have an 8ema bounce and we have a bullish engulfing candle candle… that SHOULD push SPY higher and possibly retest that critical 417 resistance. That would be my target tomorrow if markets don’t negatively react to that data. 

We are still in that breakout triangle with support at 409.5 and resistance at 414.4.

Key SPY Support- 410.2 -> 408.6 -> 405.4

Key SPY Resistance- 414.1 -> 416.8 -> 419.5

&#x200B;

Futures shows quite the consolidation here itself too but what futures shows that SPY doesn’t show very much of is these massive wicks to the downside. This means that futures is seeing some pretty impressive sell offs after hours/ during market close, however, intraday is pumping back up. 

This has happened quite a few times before and this usually signifies that eventually a change of tide is coming… 

I have noticed a lot times when after hours/ futures don’t match the intraday movement of Spy there is an imbalance in the markets… in my opinion generally speaking futures is rarely wrong… it just takes them some times to be right. 

Taking a look here we are holding that same consolidation on futures as spy from 4085 to 4193. 

We remain also in this breakout wedge pattern here with tomorrows resistance being at 4180 and support being at 4105.

Key levels to watch though that we have seen a lot of price action at is 4123 support and 4178 resistance. 

Key Futures Support- 4140 -> 4123 -> 4105

Key Futures Resistance- 4160 -> 4178 -> 4193

Somewhat surprising today Tesla actually didn’t show a lot of strength… it held within a fairly tight $2 closing range for a large portion of the day. However, after a sell off during Bidens speech it found all the strength it needed and made a massive push up to close at that key 215 daily 200ema resistance area. 

Tesla did close out a classic hanging man candle which could result in a drop tomorrow. However, with Spy and Tesla both finishing at their HODs tomorrow we could be set up for a large push up tomorrow. 

I still believe its far too early to short tesla but I also believe whenever this buy the dip narrative pops Tesla will be the ultimate short. 

Key Tesla Support- 209.5 -> 202.8 -> 197.2 -> 191.9

Key Tesla Resistance- 215 -> 219.1 -> 226.1 -> 229.8

Interesting close here on the VIX today back under that key pivot level of 18.3… If we look at the VIX this is only the second time in over 13 months that the VIX has CLOSED below 18.3… Everytime since January that the VIX has closed under 18.3 the following day the VIX has had a very large rebound. 

January 13th -> January 17th 5.51% VIX rebound and -0.18% red day followed by -1.58% red day for SPY  
 January 27th -> January 30th 7.73% VIX rebound and -1.25% red day for SPY   
 February 1st -> February 2nd 4.82% VIX rebound and 1.46% green day for spy followed by -1% red day  
 February 3rd -> February 6th 6% VIX rebound and -0.61% red day for SPY

What is actually the most interesting about this pattern is that all but one of those has happened over a weekend. 

Most of the rebounds on VIX resulted in a simultaneous red day for SPY but two times it was one day later. 

Speaking of SPY drops here is some fun facts… 

SPY has not put in 3 red days in a row since January 17-19th. Before that the last 3 red days in a row came December 14th to 17th. Both of these were immediately proceeding CPI results. 

Spy has only closed back to back red days 6 total times in the last 39 trading days… 

We also have only close > -2% one time since November 9th which was over 3 months ago now. 

With 11 trading days of consolidation within about a $10 range we are very soon going to see a move up or down.

Started the day off fairly well today. Got burnt in that morning call on a failed breakout… I cut early at -7.6% which was the right move as we had a very large correction then. From there I made a few more nice trades and then I got absolutely burnt by the market. 

I took a call around noon at what looked like the perfect support bounce at a key level only for the bottom to fall out on me. l then took a put around 1230 after SPY looked like it was confirming resistance and pretty much every indicator I have screamed puts only for SPY to get an absolute rogue shrek and of course wrecked that put. 

Highly frustrating trading lately. Actually put in my 3rd red day in a row here in a very long time. I looked back through my logs and honestly I couldn’t even find a time that I had 3 red days in a row between now and last May. Quite a few back to back red days but even during my terrible drawdown in July to September I didn’t put in 3 red days in a row. Definitely struggling this week with this price action and these reversals/ fake outs but we just keep on trucking. 

It would be impossible for every day, week or month to be green.

11301qf,DD,AutoZone: The Crowded Room,"*TLDR;* **Autozone (AZO) is currently valued at $2,500 per share. This is due to its decade-long resistance against splitting its stock. However, its balance sheet sheds light on a company that is hemorrhaging money quickly and has shaky fundamentals at best. In the future, AutoZone may be forced to dilute current shareholders risking a mutiny by its 94% institutional holders. With low liquidity and a high level of institutional investing, any fund that begins to sell out of its position will potentiate a downward spiral. For this reason, I believe that AZO is currently grossly overvalued even at its current EPS and analyst forecasts. AutoZone reports earnings on 02/28 which I believe will lead to AZO's decline in valuation.** 

&#x200B;

The argument can be made that, at any given time a stock is valued precisely as it should be. Every seller must have a buyer willing to pay the quoted price. It is up to the investor's discretion, however, whether or not they are willing to place a similar value on the security being offered. In looking at the stock valuation of Autozone (AZO), I will try to summarize how this principle has led investors to grossly overpay for a company that is most likely hemorrhaging money.



https://preview.redd.it/ctux814zpcia1.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d771505873c08639162ad327ccaca69380d4528d

Here we have AutoZone's (AZO) stock summary. Ignoring the +36,936% increase in stock valuation since the early '90s, we can see that AZO has maintained a modest amount of shares outstanding for being such a seasoned company. The $2,546 per stock valuation reflects the company's avoidance of performing any stock splits since 1994. Similar to Berkshire Hathaway's strategy, avoiding stock splits allows for a decreased dilution of shares and ultimately more value returned to shareholders per stock held (in theory).

The daily volume of shares exchanged per day is typically low, and it takes fewer shares to move the price of the stock. This strategy also has the added benefit of boosting EPS, as earnings are not spread as thinly across millions of shares. AZO's PE ratio is 21.38, which is moderately high but does not raise too many red flags. Therefore, on the surface, it looks like a solid company with astounding earnings and a flawless track record. 

But when we dig deeper into AZO's balance sheet, we find some concerning abnormalities.

  

[Earnings typically peak in August and Bottom in February](https://preview.redd.it/wjr6c23bscia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3982814a0cbffca495de4bbab38927ebcab301d4)

I don't prefer to use revenue alone as a means of gauging a company's solvency, as it often doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of its operations. Operating income is much more comprehensive and equates to *Revenue - Cost of Revenue - Operating Expenses*. This provides a much clearer picture of **how much money a company is actually making from their business.** For AZO, earnings typically peak in August and decline during the Winter months. A decline during this time period is not abnormal. What is abnormal is that AZO's revenue trend is starting to *reverse direction.* This past November's earnings were lower than the year prior, yet the valuation of the stock still implies that the market is pricing in an upward trend.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b1ybyy44ucia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac18378cd7833c6baa3234c7850af5e5bf4c0263

&#x200B;

[2020 SEC filing showing that issue of $1.2b in notes was responsible for the injection of cash](https://preview.redd.it/91a7tppqvcia1.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1daa22503a8f82ba9bedec2527384eb8f32169bd)

Cash and Cash equivalents can give us insight into how much liquid capital a company has quick access to if necessary. For the quarter that ended in November 2021, this liquid capital came back down to pre-pandemic levels. This tells us that the large sum of cash raised by issuing notes was quickly spent. It is concerning that such a large sum of money only held them over for a few quarters and without another similar injection, I see them burning through the remaining cash very quickly.  

 

https://preview.redd.it/x8hjnxu4ycia1.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5dd51beb7d1ad91d082f5fe11401c501acf7efa5

AZO's balance sheet also shows that liabilities are quickly outpacing assets. This is not uncommon, especially for companies that are based out of brick-and-mortar locations. However, This does not leave them much room for error when managing their balance sheet.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e27rgp3nzcia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bef1d904fb0372653f51c52e75856824c6465bd

To emphasize the severity of the hemorrhage, AutoZone's working capital currently sits at ***-$2b***. It should be noted that some industries require more working capital than others as their operations aren't as liquid and may not be able to generate short-term capital quickly from customers. Even with this in mind, for the past 2 years, AutoZone has been operating far below its typical threshold for working capital requirements. 

Simply put, AutoZone has never been this strapped for cash in the history of the company. ***Yet its stock valuation is still sitting around its all-time high.*** 

So then, what is AZO's true value?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p5qgagq81dia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8736fbcf3ded614f8d615bd4ca11105574d8ef8

Although book value is not always an accurate metric for gauging the value of a company, it still provides some important information. Book value is typically measured as the sum of a company's assets less its liabilities assuming they can be sold. If AutoZone was to hypothetically sell all of its assets and pay off its outstanding obligations *today*, this metric would give us the value investors could expect their shares to be worth. Their shares wouldn't actually yield -$176 to state the obvious, but it does show how deep the bullet lies. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/d1j1ryh53dia1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=daf2de9ac7426e39acd718751d6d42fee4f20310

Ultimately, this is not a ""doom and gloom"" post about how I believe AZO is plummeting toward insolvency. I just cannot imagine any justification for a $2,500/share valuation of a company that has the balance sheet of a penny stock. The numbers are larger, sure, but the ratios are eerily similar. This isn't the first stock that I have seen with a grossly inflated valuation, but it is a staple of many mutual funds, trusts, and ETFs. In a risk-off market environment or if macroeconomic sentiment shifts, I can see it as one of the first to go. 

&#x200B;

[Control is wholly owned by institutions](https://preview.redd.it/x0r6ldes5dia1.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=785e04088e86b1984111099d4da80233d6291400)

[AZO appears to play a key role in many mutual funds](https://preview.redd.it/t25pydnp5dia1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c878ad2ca29b4a45bc3f9272d89aff805416baf7)

Because funds have been building positions for decades and holding shares, AutoZone has historically been immune to significant downside swings or price volatility in previous years. However, their balance sheet expresses that there are some pretty significant reasons for funds to re-evaluate if they truly want to continue holding a hemorrhaging company.

So far the path for AutoZone's stock has been a straight line, but all good things must come to an end. Gravity will bring it back down to Earth. With an average daily volume profile of around \~100,000 shares, the most pain will come in the form of low liquidity. 

&#x200B;

With 94% of shares owned by institutions, any firm that chooses to sell out of its position will potentiate a downward spiral. When there's a fire nobody wants to be the last one to the exit.

[CRM Thinking It's 2019](https://preview.redd.it/n0euuj1s19ia1.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7f9d65da82664336ce0a086976885e795c5b8864)

TLDR: Investors may change their view on CRM as they see clients cutting on spending, and competitors starting to take market share by developing in specialized niches. CRM's growth verticals are drying up, and the company will meet expectations on earnings day, but may have little to offer for the future.

Also, I'm great at being wrong.

# Analysis

Earnings date: 1st March. 

Market cap: $170b

My estimated value: $118b = 30% downside

[CRM est. Intrinsic Value of $118b](https://preview.redd.it/9i6vy07vs8ia1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63427def8cb50cd695c96a621fa93872af6ff857)

Model: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/163a1XCFOcl7wOBvnOUk-v-4EcOoLmS7MVOKD9RHjoS8/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/163a1XCFOcl7wOBvnOUk-v-4EcOoLmS7MVOKD9RHjoS8/edit?usp=sharing)

CRM [expects](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2022/Salesforce-Announces-Solid-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2023-Results/default.aspx) to end 2023 with $31b in revenue, implying a 20% Y/Y growth.

My view is that CRM has settled into its market share and there are no high-growth verticals coming in the near future. Even growth acquisitions will be harder to pull off given higher interest rates.

The way I see it, investors were right in slowly bleeding CRM's valuation, however we are experiencing a bump in equity values across stocks which will be corrected in CRM over time as investors are hit with negative surprises changing their growth and profitability story.

Here are my future expectations for CRM:

[My Expected Growth Model for CRM](https://preview.redd.it/p3henzqju8ia1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7d0ab09377273d6ced539f8e0aa713b81b264a09)

You can see that even this model may be optimistic as I am giving CRM 25% EBIT margins, and $80b revenue at maturity. 

My guess is that management will change the story on growth, pretending to be focused on profitability, and investors will slowly change the expectation of margins on account of the increasing competition in CRM/ERP software. As technology costs go down, smaller companies can offer specialized solutions that are going to take market share from the company, and existing clients will start developing in-house alternatives in a bid to ""tighten the belt"" during 2023.

# CRM's Friends

Competitors include:

* SAP: Enterprise grade ERP, CRM + analytics
* MSFT: Teams + Dynamics + Office
* ORCL: Hyperion ERP
* GOOGL: Productivity suite for small-med businesses. But mostly there to illustrate how bad things can get if investors panic.
* Additional peers: SAGE, HubSpot, ServiceNow, Atlassian, Asana

We can see that the market is still pricing CRM at 6x EV/Sales which is usually attributed to high-growth companies. To me, CRM's growth story stopped even before the acquisition of Slack, but the company was able to leverage high equity valuations and cheap debt to produce higher revenue numbers. They managed to stretch their market, but likely overpaid on it and destroyed investor's equity value.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)

112bmqe,DD,How $ASTS will become one of the best investments of the 2020s,"Around 3 months ago I wrote a DD piece on ASTS which can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yvbi15/asts\_just\_went\_from\_speculative\_play\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yvbi15/asts_just_went_from_speculative_play_to/)

At that point Bluewalker3 had just unfurled, thereby reducing the tech risk to reasonable levels which gathered quite a bit of attention.

So how is the outlook 3 months after that major milestone?

In one word: **Extraordinary.**

And I don’t use that term lightly.

Let’s revisit some of the key topics.

1. Bluewalker 3 has now been on orbit for more than 3 months and is one of the most tracked satellites by hobbyists due to its sheer size and low earth orbit. In 3 months there have been no reports of abnormalities.

&#x200B;

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/b5l438ohy6ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5879b51e8fa65f8293d6ea18738f7e9ed3b89b06)

&#x200B;

2) ASTS is expected to release details about connectivity in the coming weeks, which will most likely include the 1st ever video call using direct phone-to-satellite. This will be a monumental milestone which may or may not correlate with price movement. But it will definitely result in global news coverage for ASTS while leapfrogging them to the lead position of satellite communications.

&#x200B;

3) Recent weeks have seen a flurry of MNO (Mobile Network Operator) signing with ASTS. The total potential user count of ASTS services via their MNO partnerships now stands at 2.1 **BILLION** or 27% of the world population. Here’s a list published by ASTS CEO and also a list from Twitter Nomadbets showcasing the insanity of collaborations:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ma9vqrhty6ia1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34a2ff32af05c70782cce33e270df712c6f8d76c

4) Existing partners like AT&T have recently ramped up their social “shilling” of ASTS and are constantly teasing the upcoming satellite broadband products. It is awfully coincidental that AT&T started giving ASTS shoutouts while BW3 call testing is ongoing. Would they be so blatantly bullish if there was still a risk of ridicule of BW3 not delivering? I think it’s fairly obvious AT&T have seen the test results and are happy about it. These are just 2 tweets of many specifically aimed at ASTS.

&#x200B;

One of the executive VPs from AT&T was even showcased in a recent video talking at lengths about the unique relationship between AT&T and AST and how paramount it is for their rural coverage plans. Keep in mind that Sambar is at the helm of $20B in capex spendings from AT&T. This not just a PR dude giving us some buzzwords, this is the guy who typically signs the checks.

5) The relationship with FCC and ASTS has improved substantially. One of the main ASTS contributors on AST subreddit has noticed that FCC is now often responding/approving ASTS requests within a 24 hour turnaround. It’s obvious that FCC has seen evidence of ASTS tech viability and now considers them a credible candidate to help with rural broadband coverage (which by the way is a huge political tailwind for many Senators from rural states)

6) ASTS recently secured the contract to launch 5 Bluebird satellites into orbit with SpaceX. BBs are a bigger version of BW3 which are currently being built and expected to launch before EOY. The company will need around 8-10 BBs in orbit to start generating significant revenue. With just 18 BBs in orbit they will be able to provide coverage to over 1 BILLION people. Check the 8-K excerpt below submitted on Feb 3rd:

7) Patent portfolio continues to increase at a fast clip. This is the textbook definition of a strong Moat. Once those satellites are in orbit and delivering EBIDTA at +90% profit margin it will be very, very, very hard to compete with ASTS without legal hurdles.

8) AT&T and other MNOs have hinted at the vast applications for satellite communication within the US government. Here’s a tweet showcasing the very likely prospect of ASTS collaborating with the US Department of Defense.

9) There are many other scenarios in which Satellite broadband will be a game changer. Nomadbets for example did an excellent Twitter thread detailing how ASTS could cause a big splash within the Shipping industry.

10) Rakuten dedicated part of the Earnings call to satellite broadband. ASTS was specifically mentioned and Rakuten hinted at $2B in capital expenditures to make this collaboration happen.

Make no mistake: direct phone-to-satellite broadband is one of the mega trends of the 2020s and easily the most untapped revenue stream available to MNOs. They will jump through any hoops to work with ASTS. I'm proudly part of the SpaceMob! 👍👍

EDIT #2:  
AST achieves the first ever satellite call using only an unmodified smartphone (actual model was Samsung Galaxy S22). Technology de-risking continues marching along and with the BB1 launch in Q124, this company is very close to revenue. Further dilution is still a possibility but the successful call dramatically increases the chances of trench funding becoming available.

111wxfx,DD,Ray Dalio's Economic and Investment Principles (Extremely Long) Ongoing Reference Guide," 

**TLDR:  4 / 3 / 2 / 6 / 12 (see lists below)**

&#x200B;

**Economic Principles 4/3/2**

**Four Big Forces:**

* Productivity 
* The short-term debt cycle
* The long-term debt cycle 
* Politics 

**Three Important Equilibrium's:** 

* Debt growth is in line with income growth that is required to service the debts
* Economic capacity utilization is neither too high nor too low
* Projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds which are above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums   


**Two Levers:**

* Monetary Policy
* Fiscal Policy

**Six main Factors to Judge a Country’s Power By**:  


* Innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness
* Economic output
* Share of world trade
* Military strength 
* Financial center strength
* Reserve currency status  


**Economic and market movements are like a perpetual motion machine of interactions of these nine**   


**12** **Investment Principles**   


* The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows
* The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold 
* Asset classes will outperform cash over the long term 
* The out performance of asset classes over cash (i.e. beta cannot be very positive for too long
* Assets are priced to discount future expectations. So when inflation, growth, risk premia and discount rates change, asset prices change
* Every investment is a return stream 
* Diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns so it improves return-to risk ratio
* Return streams can be either betas or alphas
* The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams
* Return streams can be risk adjusted to be risk balanced
* The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
* Systematize decision making; rules should be timeless and universal 

**Context/ DD - This is the looooong winded part**

1. We have this broken down in terms of economic principles and investment principles because the markets follow the economy. To understand the market, you must understand the economy; to do that; you must understand the four major forces, three Important equilibrium, and two levers.
2. The economy and the markets are like a perpetual motion machine of the interaction of the above 4/3/2.
3. Over time, things get better in the quality of our personal lives. We look to increase the quality of our living, individually and as a society - This is called productivity.
4. Productivity is the most important thing, but we don't really see it because it evolves over a more extended period.
5. The big things that we see and feel every day are debt cycles. There is a long-term debt cycle and a short-term debt cycle. 
6. By short-term debt cycle, I usually mean the business cycle. 
7. For instance, if the economic activity rate is too low in a recession and there is weakness in the economy, the Central Banks (CBs) produce credit. 
8. Credit is buying power. CBs produce that credit which creates purchasing power for goods, services, and financial assets - And then, the economy picks up, and that cycle typically lasts seven to ten years.
9. As the economy picks up, the demand rises relative to the capacity. As you get later in the cycle, the CBs hit the brakes, raise interest rates, and tighten monetary policy. The unemployment rate is low because there is less slack in the economy. They put the brakes on it by pulling the lever to increase interest rates. They tighten monetary policy, then you have a recession, slow up, which is the cycle.
10. And because credit is buying power, credit produces debt, and debt means the obligation to pay back. 
11. It is crucial to understand that nature is cyclical, first comes the stimulation, then comes the paying back. 
12. When you produce credit, you can spend more than you earn. 
13. And when you pay back, you have to spend less than you earn. 
14. And that is the nature of the cycle. Most of us are aware and acquainted with this cycle. 
15. With that cycle comes market cycles. And this is all that I mean by the short-term debt cycle. 
16. There is also a longer-term debt cycle, which is an accumulation of all those shorter-term debt cycles. 
17. Because everybody wants things to go up, they want their asset prices, the markets, and employment to go up. 
18. For that reason, CBs will stimulate the economy, typically lowering interest rates until interest rates hit zero. 
19. When interest rates hit zero, they can't do that anymore, which brings us to the need to print money and buy financial assets, which we call quantitative easing (QE). And when CBs can't do QE anymore, or there are limitations imposed, we come to the end of the long-term debt cycle. 
20. So now we have covered a short-term debt cycle, a long-term debt cycle, and productivity. 
21. Now, related to all of that is politics. There are Internal politics and external politics. And in that normal cycle, they are related. 
22. For example, in 2008 and 2009, there was a debt cycle, and interest rates hit zero. And that is very similar to 1929 to 1932. There was a debt crisis, and interest rates hit zero. 
23. And in both of those cases, there was a printing of money and buying of financial assets. And this caused those financial asset prices to go up and more economic liquidity. And that particularly benefited those with financial assets and contributed to the wealth and income gap, as did technology. 
24. As a result of that, in the 1930s and also now, politics entered the picture, and the wealth gap is causing populism. A populism of the left and populism of the right has an effect on the markets and an impact on the economy.
25. So we are seeing a situation very similar to the 1930s in which we are seeing a rising power challenging an existing power, which is a geopolitical cycle.
26. When a rising power in the form of China is challenging an existing power in the form of the United States, and if we look at the history and cycles of those periods - There is a cycle of conflict and peace. 
27. Typically, peace happens after war because some dominant country wins the war, and nobody wants to fight the dominant power, which creates an extended period of peace. 
28. And I am not saying we will have a military conflict, although that always exists as a possibility.  
29. These cycles have happened over and over again. 
30. Politics can affect the cycles. For example, the shift in the United States to create a tax cut helps the corporate tax picture and causes stock prices to rise. 
31. Okay, those are all the cycles. Then, we compare it to three equilibriums. 
32. First, debt growth must be in line with the income growth required to service the debt. 
33. If debt growth is faster than the income growth that will service the debt, we will have an adjustment, and I am always doing a Pro-forma. What is the ability to service that debt? This is the first equilibrium. 
34. The second equilibrium is that the economic activity or capacity utilization rate is neither too high nor too low. That means, if you have it pressing up too much or overheating the economy, that will cause a tightening monetary policy and a correction.  
35. If you have it too low so that the economy is depressed, and there’s a lot of slack, that's going to cause an adjustment to bring it up, so always be watching where we are relative to that because that is a key driver of the cycles. 
36. The third equilibrium is that the projected returns of equities are above the projected returns of bonds above the projected returns of cash by appropriate risk premiums. 
37. In other words, the capital markets produce the circulation of buying power in the form of this credit, and this relationship of the cash to bond yields to stock yields and asset classes determines how money flows through the economy. 
38. And for normal condition (for reasons I won't digress into) is to have cash have a lower return than bonds that have a lower return from equities, having to do with how the system works. 
39. CBs put cash on deposit, and people with better ideas have to make a profit to use that money to create these other levels of economic activity and have higher returns.
40. When that is not the case, the way they tighten it is through the use of two levers. 
41. The two levers are monetary policy and fiscal policy.
42. Monetary policy is how the brakes and gas are put on, and the brakes and the gas being put on become reflected in each of these other items.
43. If debt growth is too high relative to income growth and capacity utilization is high or stretched, CBs will tighten monetary policy. 
44. The tightening of monetary policy will change the projected return of cash relative to bonds and those equities, and those risk premiums will slow the economy down. 
45. And that will drive those cycles, and that's how the economy operates in this perpetual motion. 
46. If you could picture where you are in those cycles and what is happening, you can anticipate what will happen next because it is that perpetual motion machine. 
47. That is the template in a nutshell. You must constantly be thinking, where are we now?
48. Here is some hard data for you:
49. When you look at GDP going back to 1900, and again GDP is productivity, there is a significant inevitable force that happens over a period of time. Even the most significant economic turbulence you know, looks like a bump in that cycle. Productivity is a big force; betting on productivity is a big force.
50. As you get later in the long-term debt cycle, what happens is that productivity begins to slow because there needs to be an investment, and there needs to be other things. When there is activity or prosperity, you get more productivity, a self-reinforcing cycle. 
51. Suppose you examine charts showing productivity over a certain period in developed countries and China. In that case, you will see in varying degrees that productivity will bend over as they are later in their longer-term cycle—US, China, Japan, etc. 
52. Japan is later in that debt cycle, and you see hardly any productivity growth. 
53. That is what productivity looks like- Now, where are we in the short-term debt cycle of the business cycle?
54. See Appendix A & B to see what the cycle looks like
55. What happens from the capital markets (stock market) perspective - as you begin to go to higher levels of operating rate and lower levels of unemployment, CBs begin to tighten, liquidity starts to tighten, and risk premiums begin to rise.
56. As of March of 2019, we were nine years into the cycle, unemployment rates are comparatively low, and there is less slack, so it is no surprise that CB tightens monetary policy. 
57. The CB tightens monetary policy by either raising interest rates or lowering the purchases of the financial assets they buy by expanding the balance sheet. And that is where we were as of q1 2019. 
58. If you look at how markets behave in that part of the cycle, we break cycles into three pieces. The early phase of the cycle, the mid phase of the cycle, and the late phase of the cycle
59. Typically when you are late in the cycle, it coincides with less attractive returns.
60. Interest rates hit their lows and can’t go lower, so we deal with quantitative easing.
61. If you look at a chart going back to 1900 and examine the debt to GDP ratio to examine how now, it seems like the cycle we went through in the 1930s.
62. In other words, because of the debt crisis and interest rates hitting zero, you had the printing of money, as evidenced by examining the CB balance sheet, the monetary base, and the acceleration of printing money. The same thing happened in the 2008 financial crisis. You can see the debt crisis; you hit zero in interest rates, they are stuck, so they have to print the money, and then we have the reaction. 
63. Very similar to 1932 to 1937, as the economy picked up, in 1937, they started to tighten monetary policy because they were worried the economy was overheating and inflation was going to rise, and they caused a recession. 
64. That was the first time they used the word recession. It was like re-depression, and they used the term recession, which was the 1938 period. 
65. We talked about debt, but there are also unfunded liabilities that we don’t call debt - which would be pension and health care liabilities. There are a lot of liabilities/promises out there that must be kept.
66. As it relates to both the markets and the economy - we have been in a Golden age of capitalism in the following sense - Profit margins have more than doubled since 2000, meaning that if you didn't have an expansion in profit margin - the stock market would be 40% lower. 
67. Profit margins grew because of several factors such as efficiencies gained with technology, globalization creating a larger market share, and companies reducing union membership, which reduced employee compensation and contributed to the growth of the wealth gap. 
68. The wealth gap or profit gap has been great for companies, but it has not been great for a certain percentage of the population. If you look at the conditions of the bottom 60% percent of the population, and the bottom 60 means the majority, the conditions have been bad. 
69. Since 1980 there has been no real income growth in the United States. In a Fed survey, 40% of all Americans could not raise $400 in the event of an emergency. So there is a gap.
70. The wealth gap is seen by looking at the net worth of the top 1/10th of 1% of the population's net worth, which is almost the same as the bottom 90% combined.
71. As a result, we have populism, populism on the left, and populism on the right. That is a phenomenon that developed countries didn't use to have. Not only is it a political phenomenon but an economic and market phenomenon.
72. Because as we go into the political elections in countries such as the US and throughout Europe, it will be a conflict of capitalism over socialism or the left and the right, and it will become extreme in both cases. 
73. And as these profit margins improved and corporate tax rates have gone down, you also have cheap money used to buy back stock or make mergers which also helps boost stock prices. 
74. Many of these items will not continue. In Q1 of 2019, this model predicted that profit margins would go down, and you were at the best of the corporate tax rates, so that likely won't go much lower.
75. This all means that we are entering a new environment that will not be as conducive to purchasing financial assets by the CB. Simply put, we are going from tailwinds to headwinds. 
76. To give you a flavor of what this political situation is like and the polarity and the entrenchedness - you can look at charts going back to 1900, which show how conservative the republicans are through a survey to examine economically conservative. And as of 2019 - they are more conservative than ever.  
77. You can look at another chart back to 1900 examining how liberal democrats are in policy, and they are also more liberal than ever. 
78. This means both parties have not had greater polarity than we have today. 
79. Suppose you include the votes cast along party lines in each chart. In other words, republicans are sticking with republicans, and democrats are sticking with democrats. In that case, it easily depicts the entrenched conflict we are having in the US. 
80. The political polarity is not just taking place in the US but also in Europe. It was expected that Jeremy Corbyn would remain in power in the UK, which would impact capital flows. 
81. But France elected Macron, and the UK elected Boris Johnson. Boris is center-right, and Macron is socially and economically left. 
82. So we are relatively late in the cycle and entering a period where CBs have less power than they used to ease in conjunction with populism in election cycles. 
83. You can judge the capacity of a country to ease by looking at the level of interest rates relative to zero, the amount of quantitative easing that can take place, and its marginal effects. 
84. For example, in the US - you go from 2.5% to zero, then you are done.
85. But in Europe, there are limitations, caps at 33% of certain types of debt that they can’t go beyond unless there is some type of agreement politically, which is very difficult to agree on anything. So there is going to be a problem for the European Central Bank ECB to have the ability to stimulate.
86. Japan was somewhat similar when they had slightly negative interest rates, reducing the ability to stimulate. 
87. So that is the lay of the land with markets and the economy with the 4/3/2.
88. Moving on to the rising power challenging the existing power - China will be an important influence in the world we are operating in for the rest of our lifetimes. And China will become an increasing influence in globalization and so on.
89. When you examine the relative output of China and the US and what is likely in terms of equity market cap and share of debt securities outstanding, you will see the strength of these powers. 
90. In other words, the Chinese/Asian markets are becoming more prominent, liquid, and effective. These markets will play an important role, as will the Chinese economy in our environment, not only in the form of trade but also in the form of geopolitical impacts, mainly reflected in technology.
91. If you look at history and what caused countries to succeed and fail, it was mainly driven by technology.
92. When you examine the rise and decline of world reserve currencies, first, to do that, you first have to examine the arc of each of these currencies. 
93. There is the US dollar; before that, you had the British pound, and before that, you had the Dutch Guilder. And as a result of that, you need to understand several things about the economies that made them a reserve currency in the first place. How did they become reserve currencies, and how did they lose their reserve currency status? This means we must watch several factors, statistics, numbers, and indices.
94. So we get down to the six main factors you can judge a country's power by:  

   1. innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness
   2. Economic output
   3. Share of world trade
   4. Military strength 
   5. Financial center strength
   6. Reserve currency status
95. Power is a vague thing, and you can have economic power, you can have military power, and you can have power in different ways. 
96. We will examine these factors over four cases, the Dutch cycle, the British cycle, the US cycle, and the Chinese cycle.
97. In examining these cycles, the first is innovation, meaning technology, education, and competitiveness. Mostly a new technology, like the 5G technology, and the issues pertained to Huawei and other technology companies.
98. If you have the technology, it works both economically and militarily. And in the case of the Dutch, it was the ability to build ships that could go anywhere worldwide. And they took those ships, and because the Europeans were experts in fighting, they always fought with each other - They took the guns, put them on the boats, went out to the rest of the world, and accounted for half of the world trade. 
99. And when they go out there with half of the world trade, they bring their money, the Dutch Guilder, and when they bring the money, it becomes a world reserve currency.
100. To go out into the world, they must have a military to support that. 
101. And so these cycles go on, and if you were to look at a chart to exemplify this with the US being blue and China as red, going back to 1500 and averaging these things, what you would see is the Chinese have typically been number one or number two. 
102. Although the world was a different size, those were all very far away places, compared to the way we live now, where it is all one sort of world. 
103. And this will conclude the economic principles; as of 2017, we were relatively late in the business cycle, metaphorically the 7th inning.
104. There is a relative tightening of the business policy and monetary policy; we have less economic capacity, greater polarity, and a situation where we will have political issues, and those political issues will be market issues.
105. Because as we start to think - will this be a movement to the right or the left - that will impact capital flows.
106. Now we will transition to the list of Investment principles (Appendix C)
107. First is #1. - The theoretical value equals the present value of future cash flows.
108. In other words, every investment is a lump sum payment for a future cash flow. 
109. So when we think about what is something worth, we look at those projected cash flows, and we discount them with an interest rate to arrive at the theoretical value.
110. The actual value that it will trade is listed in Investment Principle #2
111. 2. - The actual value that it will trade at will equal the total amount of spending (if I calculate the total amount of dollars spent on something) divided by the quantity of goods sold.
112. So we should always be looking at how much will be spent, what are the spenders' motivations and determine the quantity. 
113. In short, we estimate the total spending divided by the quantity to estimate the price. 
114. And #3. - Asset classes will outperform cash over the long term.
115. This is required; otherwise, the economy's gears come to a screeching halt. 
116. And #4. - The out performance of asset classes over cash (i.e., beta) cannot be very positive for too long.
117. Because if it were, it would be easy; if it were positive, you would borrow cash, buy the long things and make a lot of money.
118. It comes with big bumps along the way.
119. This brings us to #5. - Assets are priced to discount future expectations. So when inflation, growth, risk premiums, and discount rates.
120. And #6. - Every investment is a return stream.
121. What I mean by that is every day, you can mark it to the market, and you know what it’s like, so the key is to put together portfolios of return streams so that they balance well.
122. Dalio says that whatever success he has or Bridgewater has experienced has to do with knowing how to deal with their not knowing more than anything they know. This is because what you don’t know is a lot, and you can reduce your risk a lot more than you will reduce your return by knowing how to diversify well.
123. This is Investment principle #7. - Diversification can reduce risk more than it reduces returns, so it improves return-to risk ratio
124. And then, we need to get to the next one, which deals with understanding that there are two types of return streams #8. Return streams can be either betas or alpha.
125. What I mean by a beta return stream is that there is an intrinsic reason that that asset class will behave in a certain way that you will know. 
126. In other words, if growth rises faster than discounted and interest rates don’t rise much, you know that stocks will go up.
127. So there is an environmental so you can structure that. 
128. Alpha is a zero-sum game; in other words, for me to produce alpha, I have to outperform and take money away from somebody else. This is zero-sum, like a game of poker. 
129. And again, #9. - The key to good investing is to create good portfolios of good return streams.
130. And to balance them, you have to risk balance them, which is #10. - Return streams can be risk-adjusted to be risk balanced.
131. In other words, somebody might think that if I put 50% of my dollars in stocks and 50% of my dollars in bonds, I am diversified, but that is not true because the volatility of stocks is twice the volatility of bonds. And because of that, you have to risk balance them. 
132. And then #11. - The holy grail of investing is finding 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams
133. And lastly, systematizing decision rules is critical - #12. - Systematize decision-making; rules should be timeless and universal.
134. What I mean by that is - we should write down the criteria for investing, and then we take those criteria and test them through all periods of time and all countries, timeless and universal. 
135. Because if something happened at one time and your process is not working at that time, then it must be that you haven’t explained the differences.
136. And so, by forcing ourselves to try to make those rules timeless and universal, it becomes the standard that we operate by. So all rules that you operate by should be timeless and universal. 
137. 35:31
138. If we were to pass through some charts, for example going back to 1975, and you would think of this chart as the “rolling returns of asset classes,” you would be able to see that all asset classes have good times and times that are bad. 
139. And on average, they are above zero, but they all have down periods. 
140. And inevitably, what happens is that most investors love the asset classes that did well. The biggest mistake of most investors is that they think the investment that did well is a good investment rather than thinking of it as a more expensive investment.
141. So you can break the drivers of asset class returns into a few categories, which is true for all asset classes - two main things drive it: inflation and growth.
142. \*\*\*Basically, if you tell me that inflation is going to be higher than expected and growth be higher than expected, then I would know what to invest in, \*\*\*higher than discounted. Not sure if he messed up on 37:08 when he said ""higher than expected and higher than discounted.""
143. But if we knew that, we would all know what to invest in.
144. So those become the two main drivers; they can rise or decline.
145. And then, there are discount rates and risk premiums (sometimes written as risk premia). 
146. Discount rates mean the interest rate impacts all asset classes because the interest rate is the discount rate you use to compare the cash flows.
147. \*So if you raise the interest rate that is negative for all asset classes, and then you have, when you strip all that risk premium out, that equals the following.
148. A chart that shows what happened in history in relation to that context.
149. As an example, a chart would show growth assets relative to assets that you would hold if you had a falling growth environment and assets that you would hold if you had a rising growth environment and the same with inflation, and then add what the discount rate is and then also looking at the risk premium which would be the residual of that, and that's what we have an all-weather return. An all-weather return is an optimally diversified portfolio.
150. And if you were to examine the data on diversification, you would see that diversification can substantially improve your risk-to-return ratio. 
151. Turning to a chart that would show the holy grail of investing.
152. The X-axis shows the ""number of assets/alphas in the portfolio"" from 1-20, and Y-axis shows the ""annual portfolio standard deviation.""
153. And if you can do what this chart depicts, you will make a fortune and be very successful, and it is simple but not easy.
154. The concept is that if you can get 5,10,15,20 good uncorrelated investments, you can substantially improve the return to risk ratio.
155. The chart illustrates that diversification is more important than good, even in picking the best investments.
156. Most people think, give me the best investment and let me put all my money in what I think is the best investment, but that is wrong.
157. The goal is to find your best ten uncorrelated investments and put your money in that, and you will do a lot better.
158. So again, if you look at that chart, and the y-axis, the standard deviation, let's call that risk, of 10%, and imagine, I invest in an asset that has 10% return and 10% standard deviation and let's say I put in a second investment that is 60% correlated with that, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on, you can see how the risk in your portfolio would significantly be reduced.
159. This means if you have a diversified portfolio of stocks. FYI the average stock is about 60% correlated with average other stocks. You can put in 100 investments; you can put in 1,000 investments - you are not going to materially reduce your risk relative to just putting in 5 - 10, which will reduce your risk by 10 to 15% if you have an uncorrelated return stream. You can get actually get better than uncorrelated because you can have negatively correlated, but let's say I put in an uncorrelated return stream; you would see what the chart would show. For example, you more than cut your risk in half at five uncorrelated return streams. If you go to 15 uncorrelated return streams, you will reduce your risk by nearly 80%.
160. This means you have improved your return to risk ratio by a factor of 5.
161. To recap, you can reduce your risk significantly without reducing your return, which is the key to it.
162. So when I look at this, I think there are two types of assets; what's your strategic asset allocation mix? What is your beta? In other words, what portfolio do you usually have? In my opinion, it should be highly diversified, but along those lines in terms of something like half in growth, half in inflation rising and declining. Then alphas, you have to have a lot of different alpha. In the case of Bridgewater, there are over 100 different types of alphas and about 130 different kinds of markets in terms of trading.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%.
