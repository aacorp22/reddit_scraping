jidirgb,"“A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. **It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship.** The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.”

ji48btr,"Thanks for your submission! 

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

* Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

* Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.

jhnl33x,"Thanks for your submission! 

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is &gt;500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

The only recourse people have is higher pay to inflate your income to it's reasonable fraction of a home cost, or a huge building campaign to lower the real value (not necessarily USD value) of homes.


But a bubble? Absolutely not. Way too many middle and upper class people still have lots of cash and well paying jobs right now.

jhmnl3y,"I always find it interesting these analyses that demand you look at the data the way the author decided to look at it and insists that everything else does not matter. It seems more the product of an inability to think than a meaningful product.

Myself... I do look at all these numbers and more and also think about things holistically as well.

From a holistic perspective, on Tesla's investor day they laid out a path to building a global sustainable energy economy and came up with trillions in net savings doing so. Now without getting into whether the numbers add up or not, it has long seemed obvious to me that moving to sustainable energy will be a massive net economic boon. So when I think of Tesla, single quarter results are of little meaning, because I view them as leading by far in an area where the rewards or riches in the coming years are far greater than what we have seen so far. I think that they have a very high chance of succeeding in capitalizing on those riches and we should expect long-run, Tesla's financial results to be very strong.

And from a financial perspective... They are increasing production and selling the cars. This rapid growth will at times not align with short-term changes in supply and demand. Further, they have a path to cutting costs substantially over time, but the timing of those cost reductions may also not align with fluctuations in supply and demand. The natural result is we should absolutely expect to see weaker quarters profit-wise as they grow. So long as they are profitable and the outlook remains cash-flow positive the short-term fluctuations should not matter that much.

As to regulatory credits... From a theoretical standpoint I think they are irrelevant. I just view them as additional revenue and when they phase out, it will mean that production of ICEV's has declined sufficiently that the competitive landscape does not require them anymore.",0,0,0,0,aka0007,t2_y2jcr,12xb7qn,2023-04-25T08:32:33Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12xb7qn/tesla_negative_growth_exploring_earning_report/jhmnl3y/

jhbsa76,"Math from someone on ST:

Annualizing the $303.15 MM in damages (which is exactly 75% of the $404.2 MM upper limit that Gilstrap set) to come up with potential annual royalties for both Samsung and all other infringers (any assumptions error on the conservative side - feel free to point out corrections/errors with sources). 
 
Assumptions: 
 
'339 - 12/20/2021 (infringement date) = 16 mos. 
 
'918 - 07/15/2020 = 33 mos. + '054 - 12/20/2021 = 16 mos. 
Average: (33 + 16) / 2 =  24.5 mos. (averaging the two periods) 
 
'160 - 05/03/2022 = 11 mos. 
'060 - 05/03/2022 = 11 mos. 
 
'339 - $33.15 MM / 16 mo. X 12 = $24.86 MM per yr. 
'918 &amp; '054 - $147.23 MM / 24.5 X 12 = $82 MM per yr. 
'160 &amp; '060 - $122.78 MM / 11 = $133.94 MM per yr. 
 
$24.86 + $82 + $133.94 = $240.78 MM (41% of market) 
 
$240.78 / 41% X 59% = $346.48 MM (59% of market) 
 
$240.78 + $346.48 = $587.26 MM (100% of market) 
 
So  $587.26 MM potential annual royalties from just these 5 patents alone!",7,0,7,0,superjeffs,t2_a6o25yja,12vdgfo,2023-04-22T22:56:16Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12vdgfo/nlst_wins_300_million/jhbsa76/

The company has a market cap of $500 million and trades at 2 million shares per day on average. The float for this stock is 35%. Based on the current price, I believe that Zion could be a good long play as it looks to be trading above its moving averages and has strong support at $1.50.
2. CFG: Citizens Financial Group is a regional bank with operations in the United States and Britain. The company has a market cap of $30 billion and trades at around 95 million shares per day on average (float = 30%).CFG looks like it could be forming a bullish flag pattern which would indicate further upside potential from here; however, I would wait for confirmation before taking any positions in this stock .

We are writing to you in light of recent discoveries which may impact previous discussions had with regard to ""Proxy Voting"". The Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued guidance requiring asset managers to report the number of shares not voted. This potentially conflicts with the SEC's proxy voting rules which require asset managers to vote in the best interests of clients.  Furthermore, there are limits on the ability of asset managers to limit the lending or borrowing of voting rights when they lend out shares (via DTC or other depositories or clearinghouses). These limits are in place market disruption and ensure confidence within our financial system.

jgyv6jr,"They're all good points, but, just because I like a little debate:

For your first point, actually not true at all. 1990s bear market, 1980 bear market, 1982 bear markets all didn't have circuit breakers.

For your second and third points, that's not true either if you look at previous historical bear markets (there's a tendency to only look at 2008 which is just one of several bear markets in history):

7/84 - 3/87 = 104% ATH

11/88 - 5/90 = 39% ATH

12/94 - 7/98 = 166% ATH

Fourth and fifth point are up for debate, but all I'll say is that Europe is in a much worse situation than we are, they are still at double digit inflation, economically they have been doing worse. And their stock markets are at all time highs right now.

jguh4lz,"Thank you for your reply. 

If they have a good enough FCF they can pay off dept, or at least not go in to further dept. And it seems it's already priced into the stock price ( maybe a little too much?)

as for downtrend... IDK my style is buying when things are crashing, if I don't buy when a stock drops 90.69% when should I? 

Anyways that's not the point, the point is will TDOC be a multibagger, in a few years ?",1,0,1,0,iceyoh,t2_46ulj67d,12rhndz,2023-04-19T05:24:43Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12rhndz/is_it_just_me_or_is_tdoc_super_cheap_right_now/jguh4lz/

jguxaa8,"I think it's a very favourable risk-reward opportunity at the current prices. I'm not a professional though so please feel free to point out any mistakes in the thesis. Most arguments come from their annual reports and other investors' thesis, that I just put together, so I claim no rights to what has been written below.

Here is a brief write-up:

&amp;#x200B;

**Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN)**

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the business (sector, cyclicality)?**

Telecommunications, network services, security, cloud solutions. Headquarters in Louisiana, United States. 

Defensive, and technically not cyclical, but the whole telecom sector is beaten down badly (Verizon, AT&amp;T, Liberty, Vodafone, DISH all down on a 5Y chart; Comcast and Charter more or less breakeven, and only T-Mobile up significantly).

The business structure is fairly complicated, as it is made up of multiple components:

· Century Link (legacy business): parent company, rural US slow-connection telecom and TV cable, shrinking business

· Level 3 Communications: bought in November 2017 for $34 billion, fiber infrastructure, high-speed internet connection

· Qwest: bough in 2011 for $12 billion, more landline phone and TV cable infrastructure

Technically these are mergers and not acquisitions, hence the complicated structure. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How it makes money?**

The company owns 160,000 on-net buildings and 400,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally (most revenue comes from the US). 

The most valuable asset is Level 3 as it is the high-speed internet provided and a growing part business. The money generated through IP services (connectivity) via fiber infrastructure. On-net buildings means simply owning fiber assets (and copper) wiring in commercial buildings. In simple terms: internet provider.

Money also comes from ‘wholesale’, which means other companies using their fiber cables to provide internet. To a smaller extent: cloud security, services (cloud storage, caches, etc.).

Contracts with the public sector, government grants to lay fiber in rural areas, US government departments deals (Defense Information Systems Network).

Still marginal profits from landline phones, going to zero in a long term but generates no costs.

In principle, the legacy business is used to “milk” the cash from it and use it to grow the revenue high-speed broadcast, namely, Level 3 part. They already sold parts of the rural assets to shift more toward urban/suburban internet broadband providing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is it shareholder friendly (buybacks, dividends)?**

Dividend program cancelled in Q4 2022.

Buyback programs: 

· August 2021 – December 2021: repurchased 80.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market for an aggregate market price of $1.0 billion; average purchase price of $12.36 per share = yield of 8-9% returned to shareholders.

· In Q4 2022: a new $1.5 billion two-year share repurchase plan authorized = at the current market cap that would account for over 30% annual yield (!), which is massive as long as there is a cash flow to execute the program. As of Q4 2022, they already repurchased $200m worth of shares for the average share price of $6.07.

Can it go bankrupt (financial health)?

They do have a high debt which is concerning. The current debt (as of Q4 2022) is $20.5 billion.

At the same time, though, they generated stable Free Cash Flow of $2.260 billion for 2022, $3.742 billion for 2021, and $2.979 billion for 2020. The ratio of LTL/FCF is huge, as it sits around 15 (meaning they would need 15 years to pay-off the long-term liabilities, including debt, with these FCF levels). 

However, after ditching the dividend, the FCF has been used mainly to repurchase debt: $9.9 billion in 2022, $1.5 billion in 2021. This both lowers the debt but also lowers FCF on the balance sheet. The debt has been decreased to around $20 billion in 2022, from around $30 billion in 2021. The current net debt to EBITDA ratio is 2.8 (vs 3.6 in 2021, and steadily decreasing since 2017). This is lesser ratio than AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, and only slightly higher than Comcast.

Unlikely to go bust if they commit to repaying debt (even at yearly rate less than 60% of what they did in 2022). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why this opportunity exists?**

The company on the pretty much constant decline since $41/share high in October 2014 (down 95%).

From 2017: the acquisition of Level 3 Communication, CenturyLink management failed to run the new business and then was replaced by Level 3 management, a lot of ambiguity in valuing a new business, parts of which grow and parts of which decline; uncertainty &amp; concerns over the deal = stock falls.

September 13, 2022: announcement of a new CEO, the former president of Microsoft, new management for business transformations to drive growth; Jeff Storey (a previous Level 3 CEO) steps down; uncertainty. Stock falls from $10.1 to $9.15.

November 02, 2022: elimination of the dividend. The dividend yield at the time was 13%, the reason a lot of investors held the stock, who now sold. Also, dividend ETFs forced to sell. In a long run, a good decision to make to invest into repaying debt and buybacks. Stock falls from $7.8 to $5.8.

February 07, 2023: released Q4 2022 earnings beating EPS by nearly 90%, though revenue Y/Y decline of over 20% and gloomy outlook for the future year(s). Stock falls from $4.99 to $3.95.

March 6, 2023: announcements of the company being kicked out of the S&amp;P500 as the market cap declined, ETFs forced to sell. Stock falls from $3.30 to $2.48.

Therefore, a lot of uncertainty and restructuring changes = higher risk. Moreover, huge index sells as dividend was cut and market cap fallen rapidly. 

Nonetheless, the market is likely massively overreacting given the past cash flow performance and debt repayment efforts, regardless of the turnaround execution.

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

· Small insider ownership means the stock is subject to higher volatility and passive investing strategies (the biggest owner is Vanguard, follow by Temasek and BlackRock).

· The debt: if the trend reverses and the management stops repaying debt and i.e., goes back to paying high dividend instead (which seems unlikely but who knows), the risk of them going under grows significantly.

· If they fail to stay profitable (they were unprofitable for 5 out of 20 past years) in the future, that undermines the point of buybacks, which then create no value. Their FCF is significantly lowered because of debt repayment but that that needs to be monitored. If they fail to generate cash, they are worth nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future outlook &amp; catalysts**

· Turnaround: they do seek to grow and focus on the core fiber business; new CEO claims she seeks to simplify the business and focus on “doing fewer things better”, which makes sense. They already sold parts of the business. 2023-2024 are meant to be the transition years for investments into quantum fiber high-speed internet connection. The total addressable with increased demand grows as well making it likely to succeed in the long run despite competition.

· Acquisition: The have so much physical assets, namely, the fiber already in the ground someone is likely to buy the company off just for this reason. The company currently trades at 3-6x EBITDA. They already sold ‘less valuable’ parts of the business for around 9x EBITDA. Similar cases include: Zayo bough by EQT at 12.5x EBITDA, Stonepeak acquiring fiber assets for around 15x EBITDA.

· Value appreciation: As they continue generate free cash flow and pay down debt to deleverage the company, it all of a sudden emerges as low debt profitable business generating FCF yet trading at the prices near the bankruptcy. The market would likely reevaluate over the years and give it a proper P/E and P/FCF multiple as the risk of going down decreases.

Alternatively, there is some speculation they could spin-off Level 3 Communications at some point in the future to unlock value for shareholders.",4,0,4,0,HumanPanini,t2_ao6ghalk,12pleen,2023-04-19T09:04:43Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12pleen/update_on_lumn/jguxaa8/

jge5161,"I think right now that has more to do with the strong vanna and charm effects leading into April OPEX. Flows are at their strongest this week into wednesday VIXperation. Dealers are having to buy back their hedges (bought to hedge against hedge fund put buying) as market rallies, which causes more vol dampening, which leads to market rallying more, and is a snowball effect.

Friday the market was dropping despite vol getting compressed due to the strong 0dte put negative delta flow. Market is so low volume illiquid right now, that 0dte players have a big effect. Basically spy hit 415, a technical level, which all the 0dte whales shorted, pushed us low, then took profit, covered their shorts, leading to rebound in afternoon.

Would have likely been big green if it wasn't for 0dte.

Also remember that the linke I shared are shorts on the futures contracts, they're not puts on the SPX index, so it doesn't really show up on the VIX. Also be aware that these are shorts that have been accumulated since January, they weren't all bought recently, so they wouldn't even show up on VIX since they are long dated short bets made months ago.

jgitetf,"My view on the stock price was always premised on the condition when conversion happens.

That was supposed to happen by 3/15/2023 but the court case delayed that and until the ""status quo"" order is lifted it will be delayed further.

With the prior settlement, thought it would have a strong chance of happening this or last week, but the court sad no to that.

Now, I was leaning towards it happening shortly after 4/27/2023 but with the new settlement moving forward, it might not happen till the settlement is final which may take a few months (end of Jun or Jul). Maybe they think a small chance it will happen sooner, but can't count on that.

Once conversion happens I strongly believe the share price will collapse.",1,0,1,0,aka0007,t2_y2jcr,12m5xyq,2023-04-16T20:02:47Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12m5xyq/amc_class_action_lawsuit_analysis/jgitetf/

jggie2n,"I agree post-conversion the collapse here will be spectacular.

It does not take much work to realize that post-conversion, you will have Antara selling all their shares 150M+ and you will open up around 200M additional shares for shorting (simple math based on current short interest on each APE and AMC). AMC currently has a float of about 500M with 130M shorts, for a total effective share count of 630M. You are now talking about 50%+ of that amount of shares being sold within days. Further, the company will be itching to dilute and assuming this fire sale causes the share price to collapse, as I expect, the company will be looking to sell possibly billions of shares more (if you do the math without the split, which just confuses things, effectively the company will have 4B shares to sell after the conversion).

Just one caution... The judge (Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn) on Friday adjourned the 4/27 preliminary injunction hearing and is moving forward with the settlement process. The judge noted that the status quo order remains in place (this is important as it was previously dependent on a ruling in the preliminary injunction hearing, but now that hearing is adjourned that it still remains in place and the judge is specifying this, indicates the judge likely wants it to remain in place until the settlement is finalized).

The best analysis I have heard so far suggests that the status quo order will likely stay in place until the settlement hearing which normally requires 60 days for notice and a chance for class members to object.

Basically, I would no longer count on the conversion happening before sometime end of June 2023. It may happen sooner (perhaps they can convince the judge to lift that order sooner), but the legal process as it stands now does not seem to support it.",1,0,1,0,aka0007,t2_y2jcr,12m5xyq,2023-04-16T07:55:12Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12m5xyq/amc_class_action_lawsuit_analysis/jggie2n/
jgg8w3v,"Fantastic write-up.  Taking your well written and presented thought process, I think APE shares are actually indicating where AMC is heading post conversion and RS. 

my thinking is that since there is such a large mathematical arb, and since APE remains lower, which it shouldn’t be given the arb potential post conversion, the market believes even if the deal goes through, which you explain the reasons for succinctly, that the new AMC will be worth much less per share than it is at now. Makes total sense: 

1. Post split who wants to own a company that doesnt control its own revenue stream? AMC is at the constant whim of whether or not the movies they are showing are good or not. That’s why AA has been tweeting about concession sales - it’s the primary area for revenue growth AMC can control, although even that is limited. Every upgrade of their delivery platform costs them more money. What other improvements are left to do?  5000 foot screens?  Super duper THX?  Seats that give you a bj while your watching a movie?  Ok that might work. 

2. Reverse stock splits are 9 out of 10 times not bullish for a short period after the split. Over 3 decades as a portfolio manager I can’t remember 1. Now, that is somewhat skewed bc most times rs occurs to meet a listing requirement. But still. 

3. Many of the current holders of the stock are not very smart. They bought on the hype. All you have to do is read the posts in the AMC sub. I state this as an observation not as a put down. 

4. Lack of intelligence exhibit 1: 90% of posts over there are about high CTB. CTB is not a regulatory result, it’s a free market result. More importantly CTB affects retail more. First, hedge funds et al do not borrow from Schwab or Fidelity or any retail firm for that matter. They borrow from their PRIME BROKER.  Part of the PB job is to hide who is borrowing the shares. But there’s another reason: the HF borrows money from the PB and large enough HF can negotiate a custom hedge structure. Also, a HF has a much larger total book of business with the PB than their AMC shorts and the same goes fir the pension funds, mutual funds etc that lends the stock. It would be very bad business if either the PB or the lender passed 800% CTB on to a hedge. It’s not happening. Maybe small funds but I have had times when a CTB was waived for me. I also never had a problem borrowing stock, even if it was the most shorted stock on the planet. Why? Bc the PB like my business. All the $ borrowing I did. 

5. Lack of intelligence exhibit #2: the high short ratio. No one I’ve seen on the AMC sub has discussed that shares can be shorted over and over - and be counted as a unique shiry each time. It inflates the short count artificially. Kenny from Citadel controls five firms. If you don’t think that those firms are loaning and borrowing amongst each other then I have news for you: we landed on the moon. Yes captain obvious. 

6. Exhibit 3 of lack of intelligence: they think they are winning and will win whatever winning to them means. I hate to say this but retail ultimately always loses. Bc the rules in place are not there to protect retail but to enable institutions to legally steal. As an example: hedges can negotiate pretty much anything with their PB. Margin call? No problem let’s work it out. Borrow money at sub 1%?  Sure. Then invest that in 3 mo t bills paying 5%. Sure. Then borrow against the t bills at 80-90% minimum leverage?  Sure. Why?  See #4 above. Sorry retail bulls but no matter how much you say your buyjng, the other side has practically unlimited funds. 

Disclosure: I own $5 calls. 

Another thing retail doesn’t get is that many/most mutual funds cannot hold a stock below $5 per share. Not a reg but a rule institutions follow to manage risk. If AMC stays below $5, not only does that dry up buying pressure, the mutual funds would legally be required to sell their AMC by end of quarter. 

So, I own calls. Wth. Well, bc when I was in the institutional side I would gladly push a stock higher if it meant a better profit range. I thought/think there’s a good possibility that AMC pushed higher to attract more buyers and thereby increase any potential gain on a short. 

After the conversion AMC will take on more debt, which for us Americans is hard to see as bad: bc Americans love debt. But it will have an immediate hit to working capital going forward due to debt maintenance. And that’s just one immediate affect. 

So I bought calls last week bc I think it will go higher the closer we get to the 27th. Bc the shorts will only get this last chance to make a killing. After the conversion when the adults enter the stock picture again, and don’t buy, the collapse could be epic.  Bc the AMC fan boys have no more powder. And they will buy what little more they can. And then there will gnashing if teeth as they knock each other over trying to get out. 

They think that Kenny is stupid. Cmon. He didn’t get to be so successful by being stupid. Sure he breaks rules. And gets away with it bc can you imagine if he was forced to unwind everything?  It would collapse the overall 
 market. 

Old saying: if you owe the bank $1000 and can’t pay, your in trouble. If you owe the bank 1 mil and can’t pay then the bank is in trouble. 

Due to your post I’m going to have to start at getting my puts in. I still think there’s a good chance for a manufactured short squeeze for reasons listed above. If such a squeeze can attract new money then all the better for
shorts: more meat. 

Sorry for the long comment but well reasoned posts are super rare on Reddit. 

The setup by shorts is pretty easy to see. 

After the conversion, who wants to own a company who’s fortunes are tied to 64pz $9 sodas and $8 bags of skittles. Obviously no institution bc if they did, AMC would not have had to create APE for the sole purpose of taking on more debt. All the fan bits think that APE WILL RISE the closer we get to the judges ruling. They completely ignore the more likely outcome: AMC falls. To meet APE lower. Bc what exactly will AA have to crow about?  Taking more debt on for a dying business model?

jg1yac4,"All of the airlines operating in New York City are having to reduce flights due to an air traffic controller shortage.  This benefits United vs American/Delta/JetBlue, as United didn't retire their largest double-aisle aircraft during COVID and therefore can maintain seat capacity into Newark by offsetting fewer flights with larger aircraft.

Both United and Delta have strong international networks that will see higher demand this summer from Europe.  Last summer the US required international visitors to complete a COVID-19 test until June, which discouraged Europeans from visiting the US.  American Airlines had to cut international flights due to Boeing 787 delivery delays and therefore isn't benefitting from this international traffic.

An additional upside for United is Asia's re-opening.  United has the largest route network across the Pacific.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

* Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

* Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.

jff6nr0,"I read it all. He's the beef: 86% decrease in revenue and lending rates approaching 10%. 

After a couple of rate hikes and customers could almost pay for their vehicles using a VISA. I expect leaning rates to hit 12% by the end of 2022.

Approving 95% of loan applications is called ""channel stuffing"". This means almost 100% of the humans walking onto a CarMax property qualifies for a loan. They are pushing risk into the future. 

Consumers choking on insurance, repairs, depreciation, higher expected fuel costs expected late 2022, and of course paying an extra $150.00 per month (because of increased purchase interest rates) is creating a perfect storm for defaults.

Weak underwriting standards is trading off present pleasure of closing the sale at all costs for the future pain of waves of defaults (that are being programmed into their balance sheet with weak underwriting standards).

jfexkm3,"I bet CarMax posts a loss this quarter. I’ve been in automotive retail for over a decade, they overpay to buy cars. But they tend to sell their inventory at a premium.

I have contacts at many dealerships.  Those contacts, like me, are trying to shrink their existing used inventory, at least on the $50k+ used vehicles because values can drop so fast and then you’re stuck paying flooring (finance charges) on inventory that will take a loss to move. Those contacts, like me, are building in extra margin to account for this increased volatility, meaning they will not buy a vehicle for their inventory unless it’s a home run profit wise, right now.

Buying trade-in vehicles is a necessary component of selling an inventory vehicle to a customer, but what I have seen, and heard from my contacts, is that dealers are insisting on “kicking the trade” and asking the customer to sell to CarMax, whilst simultaneously buying the vehicle of interest from the non-CarMax dealer.

I could be wrong, but I don’t think CarMax has enough of  an edge from size and efficiency to offset the bad deals they’re making buying these used vehicles without selling an inventory vehicle to the same customer.

Rising interest rates and still inflated used car values are driving more customers to new cars, for which inventory is rapidly improving, to take advantage of manufacturer rebates, dealer discounts, lease deals, and subvented loan rates from captive lenders.

I think CarMax will bounce back, unlike Carvana, but they’re probably in for a bad year or two.

jey072f,"I use the binomial option pricing model.   


Here's how GPT-4 explains it:   


The Binomial Option Pricing Model is a method used in finance to calculate the value of an option, which is a financial contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (called the strike price) within a specific time period. The binomial model allows us to estimate the option's value by predicting the possible future prices of the underlying asset (such as a stock) and assessing the value of the option in each of these scenarios.To explain the Binomial Option Pricing Model in a high school level math context, let's use a simplified example.Imagine you are considering buying an option to purchase one share of a company's stock at a strike price of $50. The option will expire in two time periods (say, two months). Currently, the stock is trading at $40 per share.The binomial model works by breaking the time until the option's expiration (two months) into smaller intervals (in our case, two time periods). At each interval, there are two possible outcomes for the stock: its price can either go up or down.Let's say that in the first time period (one month), the stock can either increase to $60 per share or decrease to $30 per share. In the second time period (the second month), the stock can again either increase or decrease.To build the binomial model, we draw a tree diagram that shows all possible paths the stock can take. In our example:1. Start at the current price ($40)  
2. First month: The stock can go up to $60 or down to $30  
3. Second month:  
   \- If it previously went up to $60: now it can go up to $80 or down to $45  
   \- If it previously went down to $30: now it can go up to $45 or down to $20Now we have all possible stock prices at the option's expiration.Next, we need to calculate the value of the option at each endpoint of the tree (at the end of the second month). The option's value is the maximum of either the stock's price minus the strike price ($50) or zero since the option owner is not obligated to exercise it when it's not profitable. Exercising the option means using it to buy or sell the underlying asset.Here are the option values at each endpoint:1. Price = $80: Option value = $80 - $50 = $30  
2. Price = $45: Option value = $45 - $50 = -$5 (but we use 0, since negative values are not allowed) = $0  
3. Price = $45: Option value = $0 (the same reasoning as above)  
4. Price = $20: Option value = $20 - $50 = -$30 (but we use 0, since negative values are not allowed) = $0Now, we have the option values at the end of the second month. To find the option's present value, we work backward to the first month and then to the present day. To do so, we use probabilities assigned to each outcome (up or down) and a discount factor (accounting for the time value of money, which describes the idea that the money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future) to calculate the expected option value at each node.Working backward, we'll find the expected option value at the end of the first month and then at the current time. Finally, we'll have an estimated value for the option, which can help us decide whether to buy or sell it.In summary, the Binomial Option Pricing Model allows us to estimate the value of an option by breaking down the time until expiration into smaller intervals, building a tree of possible future stock prices, and working backward to find the option's present value. This method provides a straightforward way to understand and estimate the value of options using high school level math.  


If the target price is far from the current price, you really have two choices:   


1) Wait.   
2) Chase the price.

I've noticed that many of these plays are priced way below (for puts) or way above (for calls)   
 strike prices on Robinhood. Today for example I wasn't able to enter any plays and missed out on some juicy gains, particularly with  MMM, NCLH, SMH, and UAL.

jesxrno,"&gt;I'm long May puts on Mertro. I think the bank is facing significant financial challenges and its reliance on volatile fintech and crypt0 deposits further complicates its financial situation. If deposit outflows continue at Metro, the bank may face liquidity issues as it has a significant amount of its assets tied up in illiquid CRE loans. The bank's ability to post securities to the Fed under the BTFP may be limited as it only holds $958mn in securities that it could post. Additionally, the bank has a high percentage of uninsured deposits, which may make depositors hesitant to keep their funds with the bank.",4,0,4,0,VisualMod,t2_6hf2z55l,12apn9x,2023-04-03T16:31:28Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12apn9x/metro_community_bank_is_the_fdics_next_victim/jesxrno/

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

jeswqwi,"&gt; I'd argue that free money printing in an attempt to prevent the 2008 crash from becoming apocalyptic for the last 13 years is causing the problem and that now that they can't print out of the fall anymore they're panicking and trying to soften the landing, but refusing to work together in doing so. 

Agree about the years of money printing and low interest rates being the problem...or at least the baid-aid for the problem, but disagree that treasury and the fed aren't on the same page. Yellen was the fed chair and she knows what she's doing when she testifies about not bailing out all depositors...only the ""chosen ones"". The fed board raised rates quickly and they must have known what that meant for commercial real estate...which is completely effed.

No idea why you think I blamed anything on corporate greed. The problem is that the artificially low cost of money caused a bunch of people &amp; corporations to move WAY out on the risk curve to generate yield and now they're going to twist in the wind. Nowhere is this going to be more obvious than in commercial real estate...which imo is going to make the MBS/CDO residential real estate fiasco of 2008 look like a picnic. In fact, I believe that's why McDonalds announced their bizarro restructuring operation out of left field recently. The markets are rewarding them with higher share prices because they don't understand what a disaster these higher rates are for McDs.",1,0,1,0,Not_Sure_68,t2_7y3g7oce,12a406k,2023-04-03T16:24:40Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12a406k/janets_big_curved_yellen/jeswqwi/
jesu8tl,"&gt; Anyway, the assumption is that the fed and treasury are trying to rescue the regionals, despite the fact that by mommy and daddy each talking out of both sides of  their necks, they're effectively causing the problems.

You can't just wish inflation away, and blaming it on corporate greed is the dumbest thing ever and a requires inability to understand basic market forces.

Basically if it was just corporate meanies raising prices, people wouldn't pay it or would go to a cheaper competitor undercutting them on average causing the business to drop the prices or lose out on business.  If this doesn't happen then by nature the business is right and they're moving the cost of their goods toward the actual market value.  Also by extension market value is probably even higher if consumers just accept it without blinking, and this upward drifting to find the real market price is why inflation can take years to stabilize.",1,0,1,0,Dozekar,t2_dro1a,12a406k,2023-04-03T16:08:00Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12a406k/janets_big_curved_yellen/jesu8tl/

jestm2u,"The extra funding is what's causing and will accelerate the inflation.  You think that banks are gonna get more stable as economic conditions tighten and more of their expected good assets have to be written off?

That means 1. more infusions, which means 2. more inflation, which means 3. more rate hikes, which means goto 1.

At some point they need to either let shit fail or we're gonna go full Venezuela.  Yes it sucks.  Use the money you print to make funds to help people get and start new non-garbage institutions including banks to help us get back on our feet and let them fail if they fail.

If that won't work, then just let them fail and tell people to eat cake.  It sucks, but it's better than the US dollar being worth less than a post it note.

We all know this won't happen though. The politicians have forgotten the lessons of the past and the warrens of the world will legislate money to fix all of this and drive inflation to the moon.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

* Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

* Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.

jeahzwh,"Westlake probably has the highest concentration of subprime, most of the other subprime lenders I can think of are just a division of a larger lending operation. 

Honestly, I think the due diligence, risk based rates, and collateralization is much better on subprime loans. I personally think the greater risk are prime loans given to subprime borrowers.

I wonder if these dynamics are net negative or positive for Cox Automotive, and for subprime dealers like DriveTime. 

I think there are a lot of challenges facing used car organizations like Carvana, Shift, Vroom, CarMax.

The play I was thinking is to wait for earnings from Ally, I think it will be a positive earnings call and too soon for them to issue sufficient forward guidance about the risks in their loan portfolio.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is &gt;500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

They have been fined heavily.

Tax Evasion Scandal (2011) Credit Suisse was accused of helping U.S. clients to evade taxes between 2002 and 2008, resulting in a $2.6 billion fine in 2014. The bank admitted to the charges and agreed to pay the penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Forex Trading Scandal (2015) Credit Suisse was fined $135 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services for its part in a foreign exchange trading scandal. The bank was found to have violated New York banking law by using improper sales practices and misleading customers.

Conflict of Interest Scandal (2017) Credit Suisse was fined $135 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose its relationship with a group of Chinese companies. The bank was accused of acting as an investment banker for the companies while also holding a significant stake in them.

Mozambique Scandal (2019) Credit Suisse was accused of arranging loans worth $2 billion to Mozambique that were allegedly used for corrupt purposes. The bank was fined $47 million by Swiss authorities for failing to prevent the scandal, which involved the use of proceeds from the loans to purchase maritime vessels, fishing rights, and other assets.

Greensill Capital Scandal (2021) Credit Suisse was caught up in the Greensill Capital scandal, which involved the financing of supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse was found to have failed to properly assess the risks associated with Greensill's loans, resulting in a $4.7 billion loss for investors in the bank's funds.

Archegos Capital Scandal (2021) Credit Suisse was also involved in the Archegos Capital scandal, which involved the collapse of the hedge fund after it suffered significant losses from risky trades. Credit Suisse was among the banks that provided financing to Archegos, resulting in a $4.7 billion loss for the bank.

jdpk5fm,"Absolutely, completely agree, however we have been in a bubble and values are going to come down hard.  Profits have soared in sales because of all this and its adding to the revenue you already know about.  This is the making of a huge bouble that is going to pop and come back down to pre Covid levels in a matter of a couple months.  A lot of public groups have been in a buying spree because of all the tailwinds most good dealers have been benefiting from, it’s my stance that too much growth too fast in an gas fire/emergency QE economy will burn out fast and investors will feel the cold very soon.  Check out the recent growth in EPS since Covid and tell me honestly that it will continue at this pace know what we know about future demand in sales?

jdpcron,"JPow wasn't dovish, I myself didn't interpret it as dovish, but it's easy to see markets interpret it as dovish.  Which they already have. Which is what matters anyways in this casino. Anything that is less than Jackson Hole hawkish is interpreted by markets as dovish is my point. 

Anyways, I think all this price action is more a function how short everyone is. I doubt anyone actually is bullish on this dumpster fire. But, it's very hard to drop when institutions are max short. Like at the bottom of the 2008 bear market, the day before it bottomed, it showed the worse employment report imaginable, and that things were getting worse. There was no light showing at the end of the tunnel. And ironically thats when markets bottom, they bottom before the worst has even come, not after.

2022 had some days with random 4% dumps. I remember during earnings season in early 2022 that even companies with excellent earnings in 2022 would have a 20% dump just because they came right at expectations instead of having a massive beat.

But now we couldn't even have a &gt;2% red day from the banking crisis. And it's easier to see below, more net short than the October lows.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

Impossible is also the gold standard in regards to taste and texture, and they have the power of US soy farmers on their side.

2. If you have to put some money into paper gold and silver, the PSLV (or PHYS) are the most likely to actually be worth anything if and when the mother of all shit storms (MOASS) occurs .
3. **MOST IMPORTANTLY - When people and institutions are buying funds in UNALLOCATED ETF's, it has minimal impact on the actual price. These funds have the ability create infinite IOU's for gold and silver that do not exist.**

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

As we know the game is \*largely\* rigged. Few other ways to swing it. And not all, but likely many of those that play the game well like to accumulate more wealth. Be it due to ego, greed, you name it, they want more money. Doubt anything will change there.  


To your point, who the fuck wants to make an old, rich man, richer? Not many. It's more fulfilling (personal opinion here) to make a dent by positioning others to get a slice of the pie. And thus live a more rewarding life.  


That's a \*huge\* reason why I started getting into alternative financial data. It helps that I enjoy sifting through the data, but the main driver is helping others. Have a long way to go but with concerted effort, I know it can create opportunity for those who seize it.

jd5l2be,"&gt;I believe that the most important factor to consider when trading options is the level of implied volatility. Implied volatility is a measure of how much movement the market expects in a stock's price over a given period of time, and it has a direct impact on option prices. When implied volatility is high, option prices are expensive, and when it's low, they're cheap.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

I share your sentiment; there is no place in the business world for those who seek only to exploit others. Those individuals give honest, hard-working businessmen and women a bad name, and they ultimately hurt everyone involved – including themselves.

I believe that real estate investing can be a very lucrative endeavor if done correctly, but it definitely has its risks.

What I am excited about and not on many people’s radar is their datacenter virtual GPU offerings. Rich content and digital assets are being created at an unprecedented rate. Older computers are being replaced with light-spec laptops and workloads are shifted to data centers with virtual GPUs. This is currently not a huge market yet, but it could develop into a major profit center if the trend continues.

jdjt0er,"Disclosure: I am long $FRC with cost basis $32 

Cons of buying more shares: 1. Lots of FUD. Doubts about throwing good money after bad money which may cause wife to find new boyfriend.   2. Janet Yellen is not exactly confidence inspiring.  3. Shorts are totally in control. Unsure how low the stock price will fall. 4. Swedish pension fund sold out taking $750M loss. Not exactly confidence inspiring. 

Here are what I think are the pros of buying these shares now:

1. The depositors who are still at the bank are sticky. Some of them appeared on the news saying they are not going to bail First Republic Bank no matter what. 

2. This bank is executive chair Jim Herbert's baby. He is going to fight tooth &amp; nail for it till his last breath. (close family used to work at FRC a while back so I know a bit about the folks there.)

3. Bank bonuses suspended, Jim Herbert salary suspended, Dividend suspended. All actions designed to protect common share holders. 

4. Treasury, Federal Reserve Bank, FDIC and the White House have been super accommodative of this bank. Did you ever imagine that 10 big banks would pool together and deposit $30B in a troubled bank for a term of 120 days (that too in USA)? They would not have done something like this unless directed by someone of Janet Yellen's level. 

5. FRC still has not yet sold their bond portfolio, they are still collecting interest payments on the bonds on their balance sheet. Some have been speculating that current share price could be equal to 2023 earnings P/E of 1. FRC has been trying to avoid selling its bond portfolio and Biden admin/JPow/Yellen have been supportive. In fact $SVB failed precisely because they had to sell their bond portfolio at a loss causing a bank run.

6. Right now short sellers are in control. Retail investors are suspecting a short squeeze may be in play. The longer the shorts hold the higher the probability of a short squeeze.

7. All other bank have same problem that FRC has. In fact their bond portfolios are considerably worse (horribly worse) than FRC. If other banks mark-to-market their bond portfolios they would cease to exist as well. FRC is the domino that will knock other banks down if it folds. If FRC stock goes to zero short sellers will next attack $PACW, we have seen this story before in 2008. Do you know think this admin will let that happen? 

8. In the last 4 years FRC has been actively poaching a number of high performing wealth management teams from the big banks. I suspect that this short attack on FRC stock is a revenge punch from big banks. There is a lot of rivalry here. 

If sufficient number of buyers gather to induce a short squeeze there is a possibility of getting a 5x return from current share price. Current price $12 target price $60, 5x return.",2,0,2,0,The_Incredible_Bhulk,t2_9rj4wure,11vkr8c,2023-03-24T22:15:57Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vkr8c/dd_on_the_first_republic_bank_frc/jdjt0er/

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

jcizxov,"Thanks for your submission! 

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

jcej3xq,SPY is a harder ticker to day/swing trade than most individual stocks IMO. The key is finding stocks that are relatively strong or weak compared to SPY (meaning they are falling or rising more than SPY). If a stock is weak compared to SPY (Like DVN was today for example) then it should move down further than SPY when SPY goes down and shouldn’t reverse as hard (if at all) when SPY reverses so it’s a lot easier to get wins and not lose as bad on your losses.,3,0,3,0,NotNickCannon,t2_oqjs3,11s907y,2023-03-16T07:09:27Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11s907y/the_volatility_continues_31523_spy_es_futures_dxy/jcej3xq/

You had to have a part of GE to be a functional trader with long term outlooks.   Every fucking fund had some chunk of GE shares.  No one saw it coming.  He is only saying that SCHW may be taking that 100b daily income and making unwise choices with it….. like the other banks that are failing.  Fuck, could you imagine if SCHW was buying into regional banks to diversify on top of crap CDSs?

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

jc2smxg,"Thanks for your submission!

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

* Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

* Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",1,0,1,0,wallstreetbets-ModTeam,t2_rnslywp1,11qe9b1,2023-03-13T17:01:08Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11qe9b1/quantitative_rawdogging/jc2smxg/

jc22bwk,"Thanks for your submission! 

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

jbxx2jd,"My one issue I have with this comparison, and without having an answer to it, is:  What is the average balance per customer at each bank?

I bet SVB  had a much higher balance and so even a few taking out money is a much bigger hit.  SVB had... kind of an organized, and I use that loosely, run when the emails were sent out to large clients to take out their money, and they then did.  

I don't think that kind of run will happen with these banks, it would have to be quite different and with a larger, much larger pool of their depositors.  

I mean, if you have under $250,000 there is no real sense to take money out, except to increase an actual cash emergency fund at your home.",1,0,1,0,SpeakerClassic4418,t2_ao6a9j9n,11phrbu,2023-03-12T16:06:17Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11phrbu/comparison_of_banks_in_relation_to_svb/jbxx2jd/

jce8yy2,"&gt;This guy is basing all his analysis on the concept of mark to market which is a specific type of accounting practice that aims to value an asset at a particular time. There is absolutely no reason for any of the banks to utilize this accounting method for bonds that they hold. They will be using a historical cost accounting basis for the bonds.

Mark to market was put on hold during the GFC in 2008. It should have been re-instated. This is absolutely necessary to value the bonds at current prices, not the value in 6 years if the bank needs to sell immediately.  OPs analysis is correct.

jbpv762,"&gt;1. I agree that the fed's approach to inflation is outdated and needs to be changed. However, I don't think that increasing rates for specific sectors is the answer. The problem with this approach is that it would create more volatility in the markets and could potentially lead to another financial crisis.
2. I agree that a blanket rate hike is not ideal but sometimes you have to make sacrifices in order to achieve your goals. In this case, the goal is maintaining low inflation levels so that we can continue growing our economy without having too much debt burden us down. 3",2,0,2,0,VisualMod,t2_6hf2z55l,11nzk4j,2023-03-10T20:15:26Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11nzk4j/the_feds_approach_to_inflation_is_outdated_and/jbpv762/

jbp44h7,"Ah, someone has selective reading.

The idea is OUT is a bit of a boomer stock - they have somewhat of a monopoly in what they do. Is it high yield/high risk no the way REITs work this is actually on par with what they are bringing in, will spending on advertising go down. Sure but contracts getting signed now put money in their pocket with hefty fees for breaking contract later.

Meanwhile, other REITs are depending on rents coming in, while OUT collects money on low carry cost real estate while having high NOI - it is much faster to get advert contracts rolling then releasing other types of real estate.

What I did in my post is provided a degen strategy that is married to a lower (still risky because it is stocks and is an investment) risk investment with a historically high probability of bouncing back.

jbmri9j,"&gt;I'm glad you brought up the topic of interest rate risk. This is definitely something that people need to be aware of, especially given the current economic conditions. As you mentioned, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall and this can have a big impact on portfolios that are heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities. If we see a further increase in rates or a prolonged period of higher rates, it could trigger some serious losses for many investors.

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is &gt;500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

First off, let's talk about what c3.AI does. They provide an AI platform that allows companies to develop and deploy enterprise-scale AI applications faster and more efficiently. Think of it like a virtual monkey wrench that can help companies optimize their operations and make better decisions.

Now, why should usapes care about c3? Well, first they're backed by some serious big brains - billionaire businessman Tom Siebel founded them, and they've got investment from Microsoft AND CIA venture capitalists.. But not only that -c 3 has already made partnerships with oil&amp;gas as well as healthcare providers indicating significant real world application beyond just theory or potential use cases! And finallyto top it all off C three went public December 2020 so we could get in early on this growth stock!!    So overall y'all animals need to buy buy BUY!!!

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is &gt;500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

As a means of improving a business and its profits, cutting costs works and is important.  The problem is that it's usually a one-time temporary benefit.  It's a trick that doesn't work as well if repeated soon.  The first cost-cutting may remove superfluous or undisciplined expenses -- it cuts ""the fat"", and may improve efficiency.  If gross revenue falls, though, a second cost-cutting, and a third may be tried.  These later cuts cut into ""the muscle"" of the business, decreasing its basic capabilities and the quality of its product or service. Without increased sales and/or efficiency, a failing business can't be saved solely by repeated cost-cutting, and that can end up being the fatal factor debasing and eventually destroying the business.

If the $CRM stock price is based on the likely future (rather than on the past), then the recent gap-up should be filled downward.",1,0,1,0,JLiverless,t2_ih0f3sr8,11h5f5v,2023-03-05T07:56:13Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11h5f5v/dd_crm_is_going_to_gap_up_even_further_with_the/jazm5rm/

javo37a,"They’re an insurance company, SAP should be the standard. This should prove my point further. They need that excess cash for operating costs. Like for payouts in case someone needs to exercise their insurance contract. Especially with the shit that goes down in Florida.

The fact they are a public company should suggest that they have a substantial customer base. Thats a lot of cash reserve requirements.

Now, stack that on top of a red year, and the fact that they are paying a $.16 dividend. Thats a big ask.

Im not saying this is a bad business. I’m saying that their stock value is inflated at the moment. I believe it’s over bought because investors any to collect a quarterly dividend at the highest rate the company has offered.

The low trading volume suggests this isn’t a stock that’s not as popular retail investors. Its more of an institutional buy.

jap1afg,"Possibly. 

It's close to being one of ""those"" stocks though. 

If it hits PB 0.2 and you buy there with money you're happy to gamble. And it's not even that huge a gamble unless they drop the ball. 

If anything good happens a PB of 1 is a 400% gain. Legalization would easily 10x it if not more.

jaqz1qo,"So I personally like IEO over USO. Do you happen to be knowledgeable on IEO vs USO? I’m gonna start selling puts on IEO. I prefer IEO because it has a $1.13 quarterly dividend, with my TDA rating it average risk, high return, and 3 stars. TDA rates USO above average risk, low return, and 1 star. My dumbass got lucky and I bought back in June/July for and average of 75. For the majority of the time I held it, I was up 15-40%, and I never even caught that stock below 85-90, though due to my own lack of attention, it did dip to 77 in September. It held strong during the October dip, and held a price of 95-100 throughout the month, a 26-33% from my buy-in average.

USO rolls their contracts on a monthly basis, although I believe that they are now using the first 4 months instead of the front month due to them nearly going under in 2020. So in your DD make sure to include this as well.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

jafwp30,"Lol... 400c next month expiry???

No wonder you’re fucking poor...

Only poor fucks get high over a 0.50 +/- on the spy 

I see poor fuckers creamed over 0DTE everytime after trading for 2 years, it never fails to baffle me

After trading for a couple of years  you should be selling 0DTE calls/puts to profit on the premium from other dumb fucks instead of getting high over a couple of dollars fluctuation on the spy 

The spy is down today, about 397 now

397 is only 3 bucks away from 400

And yet, after only 1 day of the spy going red at 397, you’re so fucking confident the spy won’t cross over 400 in the next 30 days??

Lol...

For fuck’s sake, it’s the spy we’re talking about 

At the worst days of 2022, even the spy does up down everyday 

If the institutions dont manipulate the market to make the price move around, how are they going to make gains over dumb fucks like you?

Why not we make a bet right here

If the spy crosses 400 in the next 2 weeks, you go film a porn video having sex with your retired neighbor, and if I lose, I’ll pay you $100 so that you cold go grab yourself a nice meal at McD?",1,0,1,0,CutePuppy520,t2_v3evugrh,11ekw5w,2023-03-01T03:29:09Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ekw5w/choppy_chop_chop_22823_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/jafwp30/

jaeiw67,"&gt;I believe that Musk will definitely try to roll out some sort of AI-driven product or service tomorrow. He has been hyping up the potential of AI for a while now, and Tesla is one of the few companies with a significant investment in AI research and development. However, I do not think that he will be announcing anything as major as buying BrightAI or investing in John Conner. My guess is that he will unveil some new features for Tesla's autopilot system powered by AI, or perhaps announce plans for an autonomous taxi service using Tesla vehicles. Whatever it is, it will likely be impressive and get people talking about the potential of artificial intelligence once again.",2,0,2,0,VisualMod,t2_6hf2z55l,11ekgon,2023-02-28T21:26:46Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ekgon/tesla_master_plan_3_ehhhhhaye/jaeiw67/

How are you determining delta neutral and gamma max? Just from OI? If so, I assume you're aware of the flaws in using OI for netting greeks... (simply put, you cannot determine the ""directionality"" of any of the OI.  could open 100k $100/$101 call spread which would hardly effect delta or gamma, but would show up as 200k OI).  Also, OI is updated in the am -- why not run it then?

* Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

* Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",1,0,1,0,wallstreetbets-ModTeam,t2_rnslywp1,11dazhc,2023-02-27T12:54:33Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11dazhc/i_think_i_am_ready_for_options_trading/ja7jrhe/

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is &gt;500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

Cope. 


&gt;Hmm? What? I literally gave you numbers from the earnings report. Didn't add a single ""scenario"".

It's irrelevant because it's meaningless.

Cope

&gt;They moved up over 90% within 35 trading days.

It then moved down to being -72% as of Friday at close. IPO volatility when the fed was pumping money into the market means nothing. It wasn't some great business strategy from SOFI that did it.

Cope

&gt;The reason I am invested in SoFi is because I couldn't care less what people say and look at earnings reports myself. 

That's odd, because I made a joke about closing my sofi account and you lost your shit. Clearly you do care.

&gt;I know math is hard for people on this sub but considering SoFi topped out at 8.24 and I was up 10% at around there, fairly easy to estimate my cost basis. It wouldn't be accurate but it would be few cents off. Just for the sake of amusement, my cost basis is 7.42.

I'm not going to go through math just because you want to act shitty. The reality is you are down on your investment.

SOFI was $8.42 on Feb 2nd. That's more than two weeks ago, but whatever, I'll play ball. SOFI is down 14.42% from the high of Feb 2nd to this past Friday at close. In that exact same time frame, VOO is down 5.35%.

Those are the numbers when you don't cherry pick using different metrics. You can't compared VOO drop from ATH but cherry pick SOFI drop from 2 weeks ago.

Cope

&gt;And nothing amuses me more than people talking about bags. I replied to someone about META a while back and they talked about my bags, not even knowing I bought into META a day before and was up (sold for profit already). This retort never ceases to amaze me from people who can't accept a different opinion by someone who perhaps looked into a company more than they did.

ja3d6b5,"&gt;They are trading this cheap because they offer so many shares to staff, the market dilution is killer on this one unfortunately.

That is actually wrong.

A big portion of their SBC expense has nothing to do with dilution. A big portion of their SBC expense is related to PSUs they awarded during the IPOE process, PSUs that are related to the stock price.

A dilution will happen if the stock price hits $25 on a volume weighted average over 90 days within 5 years of IPOE. Same for $35 and $45. All 3 of which seem unlikely right now, and if they do happen will someone complain about dilution when they x4 their investment from now to the lowest price target?

In my small 4yrs of options, I started out with call LEAPs on small companies that blew up in '20-'21. Next, I began buying calls/puts on just pure company fundamentals around ERs. That made me money. Mostly from the IV imbalance up until earnings or after, it lasted for a while..then that changed. Took a break from 4/22-6/22 and adjusted my 401k/IRAs. Resumed options in 10/22 and used price action on only one volatile $5 stock with weeklies and learned. Since Jan/Feb, using I'm using Chart TA and increasing my options account. Chart TA definitely has a place. So having said all that, if you cannot catch after it has happened NP,  you will just be prepared for the next run.

ja0q9ot,"Eh I agree with some things you said but disagree with others. I still think we will test the October lows and below before having a massive melt up. Market priced in only 2 more 25’s and then a pause. It’s likely now that we either go 50 and 25 or 3 more 25’s. 

The greed and dumb money confidence this rally was more than the march and august tops last year, so I expect to take out the October lows.  January rally was driven entirely by record short covering and retail buying, so I’m not confident at it being a signal of anything. Was basically a head fake setting up a higher lower on the 1 year time frame. 

I’m looking for the market to test bottom at some point in April. SPY 340-350 is what I’m looking for and probably 240-250 on QQQ.

Think people got far too complacent after January and the sideways movement from the likely February 2nd top.

I do think we will bottom soon though as market will rally hard in anticipation of Fed pause.

The next time to buy is probably in 2024 when LNG capacity starts to grow and rig counts stagnate and potential drop off because of lack of investment due to credit issues or ESG.

Not some idiot talking about Elliot wave, and historically low prices. 

Major drillers just said in their earnings calls they are profitable down to like 1.60. They aren't going to stop.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

Prolly won’t see the real effects until 3Q 2023 and the actual implosion sometime in 2024. Every time Fed got rates to 5% over the past 20 years, they popped the economy and market hard. With the leverage in the system and the pace at which they did the rate hikes, more dominoes will fall. 

But for now, I’m bullish until earnings. Too many shorts that are gonna cover massively. Plus, the inflation data will likely b bullish since y/y is coming down from strong base effects.

je80fc7,"Yeah, I thought we'd hit 320 last year, in december if you had told me 340, i would have said you're optimistic. What's made this bear market very weird is that historically, bear markets begin until 9 months AFTER the fed begins to rise rates. We actually began 3 months EARLY. Highly unusual. I hate to say this phrase, but we very early on in the season started to price in the economic slowdown, and massive hedges were bought, so this ruined everything for bears since the trade got overcrowded. Also, the irony is that this being the most anticipated recession in history, companies already began since last year cutting back on inventory, expense, and personnell. Ironically this action of cutting back on excess in anticipation of a recession (reduction of supply) already removes the excess that causes a slump from decreased demand. Which then dampens the effects of the economic cycle where a contraction shocks the corporate world. But here they've already contracted activity themselves.

I think it’s the volume too. It’s been terrible this entire year. Seems like most major institutions prolly sold the February top, which is why we aren’t seeing massive selling any more. 

I wasn’t necessarily calling for a major 2008 crash. Thought we would get back to 3400 on s&amp;p and then massively melt up w the fed pause. I’m thinking more and more that it’s unlikely. Shit earnings and another bank crisis domino could get us there, but I doubt it. 

Think there could be a pull back w earnings season, but it’ll prolly stall at December lows.

And yeah once the fed pauses historically it’s been really bullish for stocks.

j9vvrda,"Brother.  Let me educate you.  I am a significant shareholder of WBD and have been for the duration of 2023 as I averaged my cost basis down to $13.  You have zero idea what you’re talking about it you feel like WBD, the parent, generates $12B of revenue.  You are an idiot if you think that is all the revenue they generate as a company.  

Gaming has high ROIC (do I need to explain this to you?) with overhead largely the human capital needed to develop the game.  The cost to produce was in the range of $150-200MM with lifetime revenue likely to be $1.5B.  If you calculate an IRR based upon 5-6 years that is a heavy return and largely free cash flow for the company when they need to delever most.

Your small mind doesn’t understand the impact this game will have on the thought of management and their emphasis on synergizing consumer goods, theatrical, and gaming IP.  The success of this title will likely push them to double down on Harry Potter and likely seek to allocate future capital to gaming IP/throughout.

No shit the game is a one off. However it has the potential to guide them on future gaming M&amp;A so these games will be more systematically released on an annual basis which, at that point, the smoothed gaming cash flow/earnings will NOT be a one off.

In fact, the early 1950’s and 1960’s as well as the early 1980’s saw similar AI bubbles (see this interesting summary by Luke Muehlhauser for Open Philanthropy (Muehlhauser, 2016)).

j9lc0rr,"The answer isn't simple. Recommended watching some options courses on YouTube or some shit. 

The less likely you are to ""win"", which includes being more OTM on strike, the cheaper the contract. Thus the same money buys you more contracts. 

However, the price also needs to go higher (calls) in the first place for those contracts to make money. So after a certain point having more is better as the difference they are up becomes a smaller percentage comparatively. 

But far OTM is far less likely to get hit in the first place. 

Consider Delta your odds and you're placing a bet. Up to you if you want more lower odd lottery tickets or fewer higher odd ones.

For those people who are still sceptical going into MWC that 5G is delivering return on investment, can you each of you give me a single use case or killer app to reassure them?

EE: I’m not going to give you [only] one… I’m excited by what we see in the entertainment space. immersive experiences in stadiums… augmented reality. I know it’s early days, and you sort of get a part of that experience. But I think that that’s exciting because it really shows that also on the consumer side, there is value in 5G. I think on the enterprise side, I can just go on and on and on because we have so many good proof points. You could call them killer applications.

Do any stand out?

EE: The best ones today they are related to mundane things… about connecting your drones and UAVs, to the efficiency gains in in smart utilities, smart transportation, smart manufacturing. Those are the things that really bring back the business.

RR: What gets me excited about it is all these applications or use cases, they’re going to be powerful. It’s this concept of a platform for network APIs. Whether it’s implemented by this troika of Ericsson, Vonage and the CSPs, or some other party is going to happen. I think we’re uniquely positioned and I think that platform of enablement, the combination of bandwidth and higher level feature function that comes with 5G and 6G. That’s what changes the game in a whole set of use cases. That’s the platform, that’s the component, that’s the piece that changes the game. And that’s the race in the industry right now as to who is going to create that capability and allow this ecosystem take advantage.

&gt;After seeing the VIX relatively flat for the last basically 2 months straight the VIX has had an incredible 28.2% rally from Thursdays low to today HOD. 28.2% in 3 days is pretty incredible. And honestly its more incredible that SPY has only put in one -2% day during that whole time period.  
&gt;  
&gt;Actually its pretty incredible that through all of last week with CPI, and PPI that we on a random Tuesday get a -1% red day and the biggest/ worst red day of the year yet… seems a little interesting to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What was off (read: manipulated) were the V-shaped recoveries on light volume.

And it wasn't a random day.  Australia's RBA minutes were released along with guidance from HD and WMT that basically said to expect less earnings this year.

j9fbu8m,"Electric vehicle (EV) stocks are known to be more resilient during market downturns for several reasons:

1. Strong growth potential: The EV industry is relatively new and has a lot of growth potential, which makes it an attractive long-term investment option. As the world moves towards a more sustainable future, the demand for EVs is expected to grow, which in turn drives the growth of EV-related stocks.
2. Favorable government policies: Many countries around the world are offering incentives for the adoption of EVs, such as tax credits and subsidies, which can boost demand for EVs and drive up the stock prices of companies in the industry.
3. Innovation and disruption: The EV industry is disrupting traditional automotive and energy sectors, and companies that are leading this disruption are likely to benefit from the growth and investment in the industry.
4. ESG investing: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing has gained popularity in recent years, and many investors are looking to invest in companies that are environmentally responsible and socially conscious. EV companies, which are typically associated with sustainability, are well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
5. Positive public sentiment: There is a growing awareness and concern about the environmental impact of fossil fuels, and many people are looking to reduce their carbon footprint by using more sustainable forms of transportation. This positive sentiment towards EVs can drive up demand for EVs and the stocks of companies in the industry.",0,0,0,0,CaliforniaBlueJay420,t2_uovyep47,1184geo,2023-02-21T14:49:48Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1184geo/stock_ideas_for_the_week/j9fbu8m/

j9c1pjw,"I was referring to a short squeeze. When the SI as % of float is high, people who shorted a stock may get ""squeezed"" out of their positions if enough people buy the stock. This is because when people buy, the price goes up, causing the short seller to have to meet their margin requirements.

I paid my son the profit difference of $100 plus. Never telling him i was the dumbfuck that placed a 30-day sell-order at purchase cost with my broker, and the share sale was executed pre-market before the dawn of price hike and all I actually got is a mere $1 after fees.

I want my son to understand that he needs to be in the game in order to be lucky.

And I trust any effort we as parent try to introduce kids to the game is a good effort.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

j9c9anr,"Yeah I feel you. The last couple times in history we’ve had historic melt ups after the yield curve inverts and then the real flush happens. In February 2000, the yield curve inverted and then a month or two later s&amp;p hit ATH. 

In January 2006, the yield curve inverted and s&amp;p hit ATH in October 2007. The real first sign of yield curve inverting was early April in 2022. You could argue that the march top was the high. However, that high happened before the yield curve inverted. 

Maybe we don’t necessarily get to ATHs, but we usually take out the previous high that was set up before the yield curve inverted. 

I expect a sell off will take shape soon that will take us out below October lows and end sometime in early to mid April. The fed will announce in may that the rate hike they do that meeting will be their last. 

Melt up will occur from there until end of the year imo. I see us taking out the march highs at least even if we don’t reach ATHs.

End of 2023 is when the recession really starts taking shape and earnings start really shitting the bed. Some companies will have negative earnings or at least values below the last couple years. That’ll be the sign that the rate hikes are starting to affect the economy in a big way.

2024 is where I believe a major crash will take place that will take us to a long term bottom, resulting in the fed and government bailing everyone out once again. This time they’ll sacrifice the dollar and inflation to prop up the economy though.

This time it won’t be residential housing. I think the major catalyst will be massive delinquencies on credit card debt. Commercial real estate and real estate speculators will also get fucked since they usually are financed by ARMs as OP mentioned. The losses banks will take on these two will result in a credit crunch similar to 08 that will ravage our economy which heavily relies on debt fueled consumption. 

I’m really watching for a big credit card debt bubble to burst. Visa and Mastercard could get fucked as well as all these buy now pay later companies. Credit is going to dry up quickly in 2024 and all this phony “growth” will come to a stop and show up in company earnings.",3,0,3,0,keepgrindingact,t2_84glc8n,114uxbd,2023-02-20T21:33:58Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/114uxbd/it_takes_longer_than_you_think_why_the_market/j9c9anr/

j8xdfyz,"&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as everyone's journey into the world of finance and trading will be unique. However, there are some general tips that can help you get started on the right track. First, make sure to educate yourself about the basics of investing and market analysis before putting any real money at risk. There are plenty of books, websites, and courses available that can provide you with this information. Once you have a solid foundation in place, start paper trading (simulating trades using fake money) to practice your strategies without risking any capital. Finally, once you feel confident in your abilities, begin slowly by investing small amounts of real money until you're comfortable taking on more risk.",1,0,1,0,VisualMod,t2_6hf2z55l,114rtyc,2023-02-17T17:03:23Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/114rtyc/how_do_i_learn_the_trading_game/j8xdfyz/

j8ptmu6,"I don't see this take in the immediate future. What I see as a technician, is that people are fixing cars that in the past would never have been fixed, because they can't afford to buy a newer car or a newer car is not readily available. People are finding ways to keep their older cars going for longer and I feel all of the aftermarket parts retailers have benefitted greatly. Service departments are booked weeks out, not only at dealerships but at independent shops that use Autozone/aftermarket retailers more regularly. I also see aftermarket parts being sold for more than the OEM parts cost because of low availability of the OEM parts. I can only imagine what the true profit margin is on that. I can also say as someone who likes to get a new/different car every year on average, the cost of borrowing is pushing me out of that routine, so I plan on having to keep my cars longer as well unless something changes.",1,0,1,0,bshown,t2_3wfloa3d,11301qf,2023-02-16T02:06:27Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11301qf/autozone_the_crowded_room/j8ptmu6/

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is &gt;500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",1,0,1,0,wallstreetbets-ModTeam,t2_rnslywp1,112l0vg,2023-02-15T00:41:32Z,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/112l0vg/naughty_girl/j8kq8qn/

j8n4ufs,"These questions and answers really help! But and still, I still am so new to options that I have not really understood the application in real world examples. 
 
Yesterday, I put GOOGL and BMY in my Paper Trading (I started last Thursday with almost filling with M which was at $1.01 days later. OK, but good to know not following for days but possibly moving slowly towards the price target, yes?)

GOOGL filled at $3.70 at 9:30EST 2/14 and I manually added 2 more at $2.95 at 12:30EST to watch what happens and learn when to sell, etc. They are still sitting there...I really wish I knew what I am looking at. Is this an example of moving to the target price too quickly? Like did this fill too quickly at open? Was the 12:30PM price what would be more optimal? Or is that blowing past? You get me...

Sorry for long post and the remedial group questions about the questions and answers, but I am determined to get this. I'm visual so while I started Prof. Hull's book and started listening almost daily to the October Q&amp;A (like it's learning a foreign language), it really would help if someone were willing to begin at the beginning by following an example (or any other ones) through the full process (or possibly in the next class have examples in video/screenshots please please please).

If this is not the best place for that, does someone want to start a short-term get-up-to-speed group? There was a guy last fall who would kindly repeat/translate the answer in a way even I could understand it. Thank you, dude. One time through each scenario and I get it, but right now, I don't know what I don't know. The terms I can look up, but matching that to the paper trade visuals would be invaluable. Thanks so much for everything, Hardy...and thanks to everyone else in the group working this out!

j8jdkn7,"&gt; You wanted 15 Minimum wage you ended up with no job.

This is how inflation is always controlled.  15 minimum wage requests is because inflation creep over time was already decoupled from minimum wage and wages in the US in general.  Globalization causes labor markets to go international the same as products purchases and customers do.  It's a market like any other,

Did you really think you'd get international products and sales without having to worry about international labor pressures and wages?

Welcome to the world US workers.  You're competing with the third world now and if you aren't willing to work in those living conditions, exclude products made in those living conditions from your markets, or elevate the workers in those countries then you're not going to be able to participate in the market at all because you won't be able to afford it.

j8g47o5,"&gt;1. Chair Powell says that the Fed is committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent goal, and that they raised interest rates by 25 basis points at today's meeting.
2. However, he cautions that inflation remains too high and could become entrenched if it continues for much longer. The Fed is therefore committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.
3. Powell notes that history shows us it would be premature to loosen monetary policy prematurely, so the Fed will stay the course until their job is done.

So it seems in the case of the PFE 50C, the price blew past the entry price in premarket for a reason which invalidated the original thesis.   


The ideal entry is a contract where the price drifts slowly toward the target entry price, crosses the target entry price by a small amount, then reverses and moves in the target direction.
